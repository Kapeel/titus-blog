Proposal: the Python Buildhaus
# tags python,testing

I just submitted a `Mellon Award for Tech Collaboration nomination <http://matc.mellon.org/>`__ for the Python Buildhaus.  What's that, you ask?

   The Python Buildhaus is a project to systematically build, test and
   release Open Source Python packages on Windows, Mac OS X, and a
   wide array of other UNIX architectures and operating systems (see
   snakebite.org for list). In addition to providing machine access,
   software support, and process support, we hope to create a set of
   best practices and process documentation to help the community
   address cross-platform compatibility issues. We will also build
   tools to extend the impact of this effort beyond Michigan State by
   providing longer-lasting developer resources, e.g. tools to
   auto-build Python eggs and installers across multiple platforms.

   This will be an open resource for the Python community.

See `the Python Buildhaus <http://moss.wikidot.com/buildhaus>`__ and
`our proposal
<http://moss.wikidot.com/buildhaus:mellon09-proposal>`__.

This is basically an attempt to use Snakebite to push specifically to
help with the cross-platform distribution problem.
