Python in the humanities?
# tags python,snakebite

I'm writing some proposals to expand support for Python infrastructure
(think cross-platform build and test farms a la Snakebite) and for the
Mellon Foundation application, I'd like to find out how Python is
being used in the humanities.  I found NLTK, the Natural Language Toolkit;
what else is big?

thanks,
