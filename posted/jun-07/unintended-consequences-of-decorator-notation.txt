Unintended consequences of the decorator notation
# tags python

Spoke yesterday with Bill Punch, a CS professor at MSU who is using
Python for intro CS.  He told me his tale of tracking down what an '@'
sign meant (it's a decorator,
http://docs.python.org/ref/function.html).  Needless to say it took
him quite a while to google about and figure out what it did, because
searching for '@' and 'python', in any combination you care to name,
turns up many irrelevant hits.

A neat example of unintended consequences ;).

p.s. Incidentally, '@' really should be in the index, no?  It's not
there: http://docs.python.org/ref/genindex.html,
http://docs.python.org/lib/genindex.html.
