What book?
# tags python,testing

The O'Reilly bookstore didn't actually let you buy our `Introduction
to Testing Web Applications with twill and Selenium
<http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/functionalwt/>`__ for the first 24
hours -- some bug on the Web site, apparently...

(See?  That's why you need to buy it!)

p.s. Jason wants to make sure you know that the book doesn't cover Selenium
Remote Control.  Next book, promise.
