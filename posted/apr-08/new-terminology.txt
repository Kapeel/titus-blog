Some new terminology?
# tags python

In some discussions with a moderately new Python programmer who seems
to value complexity over simplicity, I may have coined a new term: ::

   "Penis size" style of programming -- the (mistaken) belief that the
   more advanced programming language features you use, the more
   impressive your code will look.

I think it's a fair generalization to say that experienced programmers
value simplicity over complexity, all other things being equal.

A search for "penis size programming" came up with `this link
<http://freewareapp.com/penis-size-o-matic_download/>`__, which is
entertainingly apropos.

p.s. I originally used "dick size", but now that I'm a professor, I have to
be decorous, right?
