BEACON funded: $25m / 5 years == awesome
# tags science,alife

The National Science Foundation just announced that the BEACON Science
and Technology Center centered at Michigan State University was just
funded.  BEACON stands for "Bio/computational Evolution in Action
Consortium" - you can check out `the Web site here
<http://www.beacon.msu.edu/>`__.

In my own nutshell, BEACON is focused on studying the evolution of
organization across multiple scales -- from genomic and cellular, to
multicellular, to inter-multicellular (a.k.a. social) -- using
techniques from experimental evolution, modeling, and digital life
systems.

BEACON is a project nucleated by a long-time collaboration between the
`Lenski Experimental Evolution Lab <http://myxo.css.msu.edu/>`__ and
the `Devolab <http://devolab.msu.edu/>`__, parts of which grew out of a summer
undergraduate research project (Avida!) that Charles Ofria and I did
under Chris Adami's supervision in 1993.

I feel old.

The practical consequences are pretty cool.

First, it means that MSU (and our partner institutions, too -- see
below) has money explicitly for supporting students doing really sexy
interdisciplinary work combining computation and biology.  This is the
kind of work that has been reasonably hard to find funding for,
especially as it gets less and less connected to, ahem, reality.
So **we're looking for really awesome students that don't fit in a
nice, neat academic box.**  (How often do you hear that?? ;)

Don't like Michigan?  Well, that's fine -- BEACON is a collaboration between
MSU, U. Idaho, UT Austin, UW Seattle, and North Carolina A&T.
`Drop me a line <ctb@msu.ed>`__ and I can put you in touch with PIs at
your favorite graduate school.

It also means that I am being recruited to teach a course on bringing
biologists to computational science.  This should have positive
effects on the state of the Software Carpentry notes, for one.  It
also means more biologists being brought into the light of Python, for
another.  Good?  I think so ;)

Finally, it means I will probably be thinking about an even wider
range of research and research activities in my lab.  If you're
thinking about starting grad school in 2011, check out BEACON in
general and my lab in particular -- I'm interested in

 - evolution of gene regulation in artificial systems

 - understanding evolutionary signals of information gain in genomes

 - evolution of vertebrate complexity

and more.
