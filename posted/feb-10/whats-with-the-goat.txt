What's with the goat?
# tags python,testing

A new meme was born at PyCon 2010: The Testing Goat.

Or, "Be Stubborn.  Obey the Goat."

The goat actually emerged from the Testing In Python Birds of a Feather
session at PyCon, where Terry Peppers used slides full of goat in his
introduction.  This was apparently an overreaction to lolcat, but the
testing goat is now being held up in opposition to the Django pony.

sigh.
