Where are the Zope tutorials?
# tags python

I've been a hater of Zope (2) for a while, but I hear great things about Zope
3.  I also know that the Zope community contains some of the smartest folks in
Python, so I'm sure Zope 3 is worth hearing about.

So I thought to myself, maybe a 3 hr tutorial on Zope 3 would be a good
investment!

p.s. What I'd *really* like is "An Introduction to How Zope Mangles, Tangles, and Twists Normal Python, For People Who Think They Know Python Already, ThankYouVeryMuch."  And then the same for Twisted.
