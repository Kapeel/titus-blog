This toy helicopter is *great*

I bought my wife `a toy plane
<http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/001522.php>`__ for Christmas,
and we promptly broke it.  While scouting for ways to fix it, I came
across `this helicopter <http://www.nitroplanes.com/3drccohe.html>`__
which has to be the single coolest toy I've ever had.  My brother
and I are absolutely addicted to flying this thing; sadly, its charge
only lasts a few minutes.

HIGHLY HIGHLY recommended, especially while it's $33 only ($100 off!).
