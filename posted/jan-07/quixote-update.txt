Quixote Update
# tags python,programming,quixote

I spent an hour or so coding on Quixote, in response to
Neil Schemenauer's `call for community help <http://mail.mems-exchange.org/durusmail/quixote-users/5625/>`__.  Result: `automated twill tests, WSGI, and qpy "integration" <http://mail.mems-exchange.org/durusmail/quixote-users/5631/>`__.  It helped that this was all stuff Mike Orr and I already had sitting on the shelf ;).
