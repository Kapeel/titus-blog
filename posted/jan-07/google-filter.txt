The Google Hiring Filter?
#tags programming

While discussing `yet another Google interview blog post
<http://www.nomachetejuggling.com/2007/01/24/my-interview-with-google-continued/>`__
with a friend, I formalized a suspicion I've had about Google's
interview process.  You see, it's puzzled me a bit that Google insists
on a fairly reasonable knowledge of algorithms, because, in my own
experience, that is a fairly small part of actual software
development.  I think "writes maintainable code" and "writes automated
tests" and "understands basic software architecture principles" are
all far more important criteria for someone who will actually be
developing.  Since (again in my own experience) people who focus on
algorithmic considerations are often rather inexperienced at producing
actual functioning software, it struck me as weird that Google would
go for this kind of person.

So what is going on?

I think Google is using this as an over-selective filter for
intelligence.  Sure, they can't get all the smart people this way, but
they're virtually *guaranteed* to get smart people if they insist that
they grok algorithms fairly well.

Anyway, I've never interviewed with Google, and I don't plan on it in the
future, but for those of you who *do* want to work there, I'd suggest
brushing up on your big-O stuff.  It's the one constant that I've seen emerge
from Google Interview Stories.
