My rather `snarky post on data management
<http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/may-10/data-management.html>`__ made it
into `Episode 34 of the Coast to Coast Bio Podcast
<http://www.c2cbio.com/2010/07/07/episode-34-technology-gremlins/>`__.

Turns out I'm now a `leading evangelist for cloud computing in genomic
research <http://www.xconomy.com/national/2010/07/06/amazon-with-rented-server-space-in-the-cloud-sees-opportunity-in-genomic-data-overload/>`__, which I
guess is true if evangelism is relative!  My evangelism, plus 2 bucks, may
get me a cup of coffee *and* a grant...

The `long and detailed k-mer filtering post <http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/jul-10/kmer-filtering>`__ elicited a `great comment <http://twitter.com/pathogenomenick/statuses/17957407197>`__ from Nick Loman:

   with blogposts like this, who needs peer-review journals?

Unfortunately my blog posts don't count for promotion & tenure, so
that would be me needing peer-review journals ;).  I also am sadly
amused that one of the most content-ful blog posts I've written
recently got very little notice.  It's frustrating that people seem to
prefer to kibitz about open access/open source more than actually
blogging in detail about what they're doing at a technical level.
We need more of that.

Greg Wilson just posted an `interview
<http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2010/07/interview-with-michigan-states-titus-brown/>`__
with me about why Michigan State, GEDD, and I are all interested in
Sotware Carpentry.  I told him to stop bothering me and just read my
several blog posts on the subject, but he out-persisted me.  Grumble.

And finally, next week I'm going to start a blog-off with `Jonathan
Eisen <http://phylogenomics.blogspot.com/>`__ as we'll both be at a
`Terabase Metagenomics <http://icis.anl.gov/programs/summer-1>`__
meeting.  (He doesn't know about the blog-off yet, so don't tell him,
ok?)  Points will be awarded on --

 - first blogpost on the worst -omics word comign from the meeting (we
   re-invented "predictomics" in my lab last Friday!)

 - snarkiest comment

 - quickest tweet off the mark ("just 10 seconds ago the speaker said this!")

 - least scientifically relevant tweet

I'm hoping to gin up a solid lead before Jonathan realizes we're competing.
Shhh.
