Matt Harrison's post, `Gnome devs too lazy for python?
<http://panela.blog-city.com/gnome_devs_too_lazy_for_python.htm>`__,
and the linked post by Thomas Vander Stichele `strongly typed
<http://thomas.apestaart.org/log/?p=559>`__, are both really
entertaining and illuminating.

I preserve them here for my own reference.
