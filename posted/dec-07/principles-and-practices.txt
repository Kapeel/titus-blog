heh, this applies to many fields, I think... ::

     This presentation is a satire of the current obsession with
     intellectual property, innovation and originality that plagues
     the field of medical image analysis. The presentation makes the
     point that most Journals and Conferences focus on Originality and
     despise Reproducibility and Verification, demonstrating great
     disrespect for the essential elements of the scientific
     method. The practice of "peer-review" is offered in most cases as
     an insufficient substitute for the actual verification of
     reproducibility. In a nutshell, this presentation intends to
     brings awareness to the fact that authors of papers are treated
     by Publishers as if they were writers of Novels instead as
     reporters of scientific findings. In that confusion, authors are
     required to be "original" (as if they were writing Novels or
     Plays) instead of being required to report "reproducible"
     findings. Such practice obliterates critical thinking and erodes
     the basic principles of the scientific community.
