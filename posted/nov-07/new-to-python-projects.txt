Projects for people new to Python
# tags python

Hi all,

I need to find some useful projects for new, young contributors,
especially in the area of 3rd party packages; we've been thinking
about things like porting 3rd party packages to Py3K, adding tests to
existing projects, and providing Windows binary eggs for various
packages.  Everything would be open source, contributed back to the
projects, etc., of course.

We're mainly looking for fairly small individual projects: nothing
terribly big or complicated.

Please dump brain => comments section, or just `e-mail me directly
<mailto:titus@idyll.org>`__.

thanks,
--titus
