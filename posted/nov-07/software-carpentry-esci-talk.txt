My eSci talk on Software Carpentry
# tags python,swc

I recently gave an informal talk on `Software Carpentry
<http://www.swc.scipy.org/>`__ for the Caltech `e-Science 101 course
<http://escience.caltech.edu/esci101/index.html>`__.  Since even
"Intro Software Carpentry" is a whole course of study, I obviously
couldn't cover much, but I tried to motivate people to get interested.
And, of course, I pushed testing.  TESTING, DAMNIT!

Anyway, here are the `talk slides (in PDF format)
