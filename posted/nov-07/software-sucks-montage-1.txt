The Software Sucks Montage: #1
# tags testing,python,ranting

Here's a small collection of links to take the edge off my general
grumpiness at how much software really does suck.  Presumably more
will follow.

`Firefox will be released with many known bugs <http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/firefox/mozilla-will-leave-80-of-firefox-30-bugs-untouched-before-release-323461.php>`__.

I switched away from Firefox months ago, because it was so unstable
and broken.  I'm now using Camino -- which is based on the same source
code but is way more stable.  (In particular, I've had no
JavaScript-driven crashes in Camino yet, and the page restore has so
far always worked.)

`NetworkManager is annoying <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/network-manager/+bug/82927>`__.

I can't get some GNOME stuff working in emulation, because of this
really silly bug caused by certain cards not having carrier detect.
Oh, and Ubuntu's wireless network manager can't find my wireless network,
either, despite every other OS on the planet (OK, just Windows and Mac OS X ;)
having no trouble.

`Chandler releases Windmill
<http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/windmill/0.2.7>`__.  While this
looks like a really great Web testing tool, I have to wonder about the
many recursive software-development-projects-to-help-develop-software
open source people tend to work on.  (Not that I'm a `poster boy
<http://darcs.idyll.org/~t/projects/>`__ for `focus
<http://ged.cse.msu.edu/>`__ or anything...)
