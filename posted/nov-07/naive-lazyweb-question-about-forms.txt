Naive Lazyweb Question: Programmatic Form Editing
# tags python

Dear lazyweb,

I would like to be able to write Python code like the following: ::

  page_obj = parse(html_code)

  form_obj = page_obj.forms[0]
  
  form_obj.my_name = 'bob'
  form_obj.my_select.choose('option2')

  new_html_code = page_obj.emit_html()

That is, we have an *existing* HTML form, and I would like to be able
to parse it, programmatically update the form settings, and then emit
it again as HTML with the same style attributes, etc., but with updated
form data.

(I'm horrendously out of date with HTML libraries in Python, so I thought
I'd just ask... ;)

thanks,

--titus
