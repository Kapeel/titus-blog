Based on the current "burn" rate of Python's task list for the `Google
Highly Open Participation Contest
<http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-psf/>`__, I
would estimate that we will need more tasks within at most two weeks.
The current mentors are certainly capable of coming up with more
tasks, but we would welcome input and ideas from the community -- and
we are fine with you submitting tasks to fix problems with your own
project.  In fact, we darn well encourage it!

So please, check out
`the New Task Guidelines <http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-psf/wiki/NewTaskGuidelines>`__ and get involved!

There's an upper limit of 102 tasks, so we could use ~40 more.

cheers,
