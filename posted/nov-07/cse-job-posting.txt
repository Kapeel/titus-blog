Looking for a bioinformatics position?
# tags bioinformatics

My `Computer Science department <http://www.cse.msu.edu/>`__ at
Michigan State University is looking for an assistant professor!
We are casting a fairly wide net (databases, graphics, medical imaging,
and bioinformatics) but I'd really like to attract a bioinformatician.

`Here's the job posting <http://www.cse.msu.edu/jobs/faculty/>`__.

The Computer Science department at MSU is a nice, small department
that's highly ranked in software engineering and digital life studies,
among others.  The opportunities for research and collaboration in
many different areas of bioinformatics are excellent: in particular,
people interested in **phylogenetics** and **metagenomics** will find
many interesting collaborators.

Please `e-mail me <mailto:ctb@msu.edu>`__ if you have any questions.
