What are the 5 best "hidden gem" stdlib modules in Python?
# tags python

Calling all Pythonistas,

What is your personal list of "modules you love and hate" -- stdlib
modules that you use all the time, but that have weak documentation,
poor examples, or are otherwise difficult to use the first time?

Here are five modules that I think could use some documentation help:

 - re (hidden, maybe not -- but I always have trouble reading the docs!)
 - xmlrpclib (once you know you need it and how to use it, it's great!)
 - datetime (check out the "Examples" section!)
 - ConfigParser (no examples whatsoever!)
 - wsgiref (ditto - and who knows they need it?)

What are your five, and why?

cheers,
