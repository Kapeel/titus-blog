wsgi_intercept has a new home & maintainer
# tags python,testing,twill

Hi folks,

just a quick note -- Kumar McMillan has offered to take over wsgi_intercept.
You can see the new project over at code.google.com,
http://code.google.com/p/wsgi-intercept/.

While I will miss the income from the project, I think that Kumar will
treat it well.
