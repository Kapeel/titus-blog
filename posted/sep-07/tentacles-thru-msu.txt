I'm now listed on the `Gene Expression in Disease and Development
<http://www.bmb.msu.edu/GEDD/scientists.htm>`__ page, as well as on
the `CompSci faculty page
<http://www.cse.msu.edu/people/faculty/index.php>`__,
`MicroMolecularGenetics faculty page
<http://www.mmg.msu.edu/people_faculty.htm>`__, `QuantBio page <http://biomodel.msu.edu/research.php>`__, and `SysBio page <http://www.egr.msu.edu/sysbio/sysbio_investigators.html>`__.

It was quite a shock to log into the CompSci cluster at MSU and see my
group set as "faculty".  As a sysadmin, I've always thought of faculty
as people that don't really use UNIX much; am I become them?  *shudder* ;)

I've also formally put forward two classes, for my first year of teaching
(starting fall '08).  The first one is probably of more general interest: ::

   Introduction to Database-Backed Web Development (CSE 291)
   
   Spring 2009
   
   80 min lecture / 2 hr lab
   
   Prerequisites: CSE 232.  Knowledge of Python is suggested but not required.
   
   The goal of this course is to introduce students to the theory and
   practice of database-backed Web site development. By the end of the
   course, students will have implemented a simple but complete
   interactive "Web 2.0" multiuser Web site in Python with
   asynchronous JavaScript (AJAX) features and an SQL database.
   Students will learn basic HTML, CSS, SQL, and JavaScript, while
   gaining an understanding of client-server programming, software
   architecture considerations, automated tests, and basic software
   carpentry (version control, source code management, and tools for
   collaboration).
   
   Graded work: weekly programming assignment and two short papers.
   
   Justification: database-backed Web development exposes students to
   a plethora of modern (and immediately relevant) technologies.
   Actually implementing a simple Web site will introduce students to
   modern network programming, client-server architecture, and
   software architecture design and deployment considerations -- all
   practical skills with deep underpinnings in computer science.  I'm
   hoping to foster an increased awareness of effective programming
   tactics and skills with this course, as well as exposing them to a
   variety of technologies and theoretical considerations.

   Additional topics, if they can be worked in: usability
   consideration; statelessness; REST; scalability; OS/network stack;
   OS process/thread/event handling; the Semantic Web; remote APIs and
   RPC; trust networks; and social engineering.
   
I plan to use Quixote and ExtJS for this course: the former because it
is simple to grok, and the latter because I like what I've seen of it.

The second course is more research-y: ::

   Open Problems in Bioinformatics (CSE 491)
   
   Fall 2008
   
   One 80 minute lecture, one 80 minute discussion.
   
   Prerequisites: graduate standing in science or engineering.
   (There's no way to make an effective prereq list.)
   
   This course will introduce biologists to computational
   considerations, and computational scientists to biological
   considerations, in the context of modern biological "grand
   challenges".  Likely topics include genome-scale annotation,
   comparative and regulatory genomics, metagenomics, large-scale
   analysis of experimental data, phylogeny, gene and protein
   interaction networks, and machine learning techniques.  The
   intention is to cross-fertilize interests and expertise, as well as
   expose students to considerations in large-scale data analysis and
   scientific intference.
   
   The course will be graded on attendance and participation, as well
   as a short presentation as part of a group.
   
   Additional potential topics: genome-scale alignments; RNAi/ncRNA;
   gene finding; assembly issues; whole-genome phylogenetics; protein
   structure; databases, data integration, and data warehousing.

Neither of these courses overlaps much with anything else offered at MSU
(or anywhere else, AFAIK).
