The Scientific Public License?
# tags python,bioinformatics

After our long `software licensing <software-licensing.html>`__ discussion
on the biology-in-python list, I realized that I wanted something different
in a license for scientific software.

Specifically, I would like to attach the following clause to either a
BSD or L/GPL style license: ::

   Publications relying on derivative works of this software must
   publish all such derivative works under this same license.

The intent is that Dr. Joe Blow, if he chooses to use *and modify* my
software to support his data analysis or computation and then
publishes his results, *must* republish the software with his
modifications.

Has anyone seen anything like this?

I should also link to the `Bayh-Dole Act
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayh-Dole_Act>`__, which -- for
scientists -- is an extremely important law, because it grants
universities copyright to source code produced under federal funding.
This is why Caltech and MSU own my code, rather than the government,
and it's why they can force me to release my code under the GPL.
