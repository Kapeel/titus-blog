GTK/GNOME / Python testing tools
# tags python,testing,gtk

I am in need of some test automation tools for a GTK/GNOME GUI, and
after scanning the `Python Testing Tools Taxonomy <http://pycheesecake.org/wiki/PythonTestingToolsTaxonomy>`__ and doing a bit of investigating, it looks
like there are three possibilites.

`dogtail <http://people.redhat.com/zcerza/dogtail/>`__ and the `Linux
Desktop Testing Project <http://ldtp.freedesktop.org/wiki/>`__ both
use accessibility libraries to drive GNOME applications.  I found two
comparisons `here
<http://blog.chinaunix.net/u/12325/showart_177884.html>`__ and `here
<http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/ldtp-dev/2006-October/000484.html>`__.
It seems like dogtail is more me-friendly (better Python interface, less
XML) and LDTP is more mature and up-to-date.

A third option is `Xnee <http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/xnee/>`__, which
is a generic (and non-Python) X-Windows event recorder and playback system.
There's a brief mention of it "in the wild" `here <http://squeedlyspooch.com/blog/2006/10/05/ui-test-automation/>`__.

I would be interested in any personal knowledge people have of these
projects.  None of them seem to be that widely used or mentioned,
based solely on Google juice, so anything you can tell me would help.
Right now I'm thinking that I will have to just try each of them out
to see which one fits my needs best... <sigh>
