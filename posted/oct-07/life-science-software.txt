Life Science Software -- Why Does It Suck?
# tags bioinformatics

Rob Campbell found me by google, and pointed me towards his blog,
`Science and Software <http://scienceandsoftware.com/>`__.  Funny,
well written, and very apropos!  Why isn't there more software,
commercial or otherwise, for labs?

There has been a lot of local interest (i.e. two or three people have
discussed it at various times) in lab notebook software, sequence
management software, lab Web site management software, reference
management software, and of course the general category of "software
that will help me get my shit done better", usually with reference
to bioinformatics.

I am, of course, most interested in the last bit, bioinformatics
software, which has the benefit of being directly related to research
and thus something I might eventually be able to publish...

So why, why, why?

One reason: biology labs are el cheapo.  We would much rather spend
$5000 on a new batch of antibody (=> publication!!) than on a very
useful piece of software.  I think this is true of most scientific
labs; usually only institution-wide purchases of things like Matlab or
Mathematica get software into labs around here.

Another reason: grad students in the biological sciences are generally
not very computer savvy.  This means that they need to know that the
software is very useful and/or very easy to use *before* they pick it
up.  How many software programs do you know that fit *that* bill??
