A quick "yo!"

No, I'm not dead yet.

I just finished reading *The Children of Hurin*, which led me to re-read
*The Silmarillion*. Brilliant.

I also just got my grubby little hands on a UK copy of *Reaper's Gale*,
Steven Erikson's new book in the *Malazan Empire* series.  It's big.  Really
big.   I haven't started it yet.

I've been doing a lot of bio hacking.  More on that soon, I hope.

I finally powered through the last big effort on our first O'Reilly book,
*An Introduction to Web Testing with twill and Selenium*.  Whew.

I'm going to be travelling a lot over the next few months: first to
Lawrence Livermore (to give the Intermediate Software Carpentry
course), then maybe to Portland (to visit friends, cousin, and
Powell's Books), then off to Michigan (to visit Michigan State), and
then to Massachusetts and Woods Hole.  Whee.

Oh, and Tracy is defending Thursday.  Assuming everything goes well, we
will officially be the most overeducated couple in our immediate family:
two Phuds.
