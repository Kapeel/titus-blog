# tags python,teaching,bioinformatics

So, I'm running this `summer course
<http://bioinformatics.msu.edu/ngs-summer-course-2010>`__ and I am
trying to figure out how to organize the notes for students.  I'd like
to mix curriculum-specific notes ("here's what we're doing today, and
here are some problems to work on") with tutorials (material independent
of a single course, like "here's how to transfer files between computers"
or "here's how to parse CSV files"), and allow students to search the
documents, annotate them in their Web browser, search the annotations,
and perhaps even do public or private bookmarking and tagging.  The
ability to edit the primary content in something other than a Web GUI
would be really, really nice, too -- that way I can write in something
like ReST and then upload into the system.

(This *is* a system I could write myself, but that's kind of silly,
dontcha think?)

It should also be lightweight, reasonably mature, easy to set up, and
(preferably) written in Python, although I'm willing to compromise
on the last simply because I'm desperate.

Pointers, comments, suggestions welcome!
