Open Source is like a mistress
# tags python,infidelity

Open source coding is like a not-so-demanding mistress: I work on it at night,
surreptitiously, after my wife and daughter are asleep.  twill and figleaf are
like bastard children, who only get attention when I can spare it from my
"real" family (my teaching, research or my actual family, depending ;)

Sigh.
