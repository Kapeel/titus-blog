What should Titus talk about next year at PyCon?
# tags python,pycon

My talk this year kinda sucked -- more on that later -- and I am
trying to come up with good and perhaps even *non-testing* talk ideas
for next year.

One intriguing idea contributed by Brian Dorsey is that of giving 5
lightning talks in a 30 minute session.  Since I like live demos, I could
give five completely different demos, e.g.

 - building and testing CPython across the Snakebite network, 30+ machines

 - Django's test framework, from an outsider/testing-fiend perspective

 - time-series analysis of code coverage data

 - N packages in 5 minutes - trying to easy_install audience-suggested
   packages.

and whatever else comes to mind.  Ideas welcome ;).

I may submit a separate talk proposal on my Web development course, too, but
I have to see how it goes this fall.
