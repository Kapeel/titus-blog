Withrow Award for Teaching Excellence

Just a short note with characteristic inhumility (ahumility? abhumility?) --
for my `Concepts in Database-Backed Web Programming course
<http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/dec-08/concepts-database-backed-web-programming.html>`__,
I received `the Withrow Award for Teaching Excellence
<http://www.cse.msu.edu/?Pg=141&Col=2>`__ from the students.

This means a lot to me, because I spent a huge amount of time on that
course (and will have to do so again next fall!)  I trace the students'
relative happiness with my course to a few particular issues:

 - I gave almost everyone an A or a B.  This will change next year ;)

 - I was as close to "five nines" available as I could be: e-mail, office
   hours, etc.  Next year, twitter?

 - I did my best to make the lectures entertaining and informative.  (Anyone
   who watched me publicly insult Django's test framework at PyCon just for the
   hell of it knows what I mean by "entertaining".)

   I'm particularly proud of my repeated references to "evil Chinese hackers"
   -- next year, it will be "evil Canadian hackers", however.  Sorry, Greg.)

Continuing the inhumility, I will also mention that the Dean of Engineering
said that he'd never had a student come to *compliment* him on a professor's
teaching before -- normally they just want to bitch.

No matter how nice it is to have the students like my teaching, though, I
definitely have a lot of work to do on the class; I rather failed to teach
proper programming practice, looking at some recent student work.   Sigh.
Fall, here I come!

On a separate note, Ryan Wagoner `posted about the MSU CS program
<http://www.ryanwagoner.com/>`__.  I am trying to address at least two of the
four problems at the end...

p.s. Re Django, that was all Jesse Noller's fault.  He made me do it -- remote
control via Twitter.

p.p.s. Django's test framework *is*, in fact, mildly fscked. I haven't yet
figured out if it's for a good reason or not -- that's another post ;)
