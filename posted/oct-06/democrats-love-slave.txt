Becoming the Democrat's Electoral Love Slave
# tags politics

I sent `this e-mail <http://www.interesting-people.org/archives/interesting-people/200610/msg00091.html>`__ to a local friend who lost his mind a few
years back and started voting Republican.  His response suggests
that there's a platform some Dems could maybe consider running on... ::

   If the Dems want to make me their electoral love slave:

   once they get power, toss out the TSA crap.

   I'm serious.  And I can't even pretend to be able to do more
   than rationalize this.  But for some reason, TSA and the
   exasperation of air travel has come to exemplify in my head
   everything I hate about how the WoT is currently being prosecuted.

   Go figure.

Heh.
