The tree-swing metaphor for the development process
# tags testing

A `few weeks back
<http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/sep-06/selenium%2Bfitnesse-is-good.html>`__
I asked for help locating links to a tire swing diagram.

And... a bunch of people responded!  Here are four links to four *different*
versions:

  - http://www.rootburn.com/pics/development_process.jpg
  - http://www.businessballs.com/treeswing.htm
  - http://www.uoregon.edu/~ftepfer/SchlFacilities/TireSwingTable.html
  - http://www.aie.org.uk/resources/humour/aie_humour_swing.html

Thanks to an unknown person who I have since lost in my e-mail (my
apologies!), Nick Efford, and Ian of the Given Name Alone.
