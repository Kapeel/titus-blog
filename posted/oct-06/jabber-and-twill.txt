Jabber and twill
# tags python

After Mark Eichin's `comment on my Jabber e-mail notification post <http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/oct-06/email-notification-via-jabber.html>`__, I realized
I had to whip up a twill module for sending Jabber messages.  Easily done; here's an example twill script: ::

   extend_with twill_xmpp

   jabber_login titus2@xmpp.us XXXXX
   send_jabber_message titus@xmpp.us message

Since I know next to nothing about Jabber/XMPP, right now only
``jabber_login``, ``jabber_logout``, and ``send_jabber_message`` are
implemented.  If anyone has some good use cases, though, it might be
interesting to see where to take this...

Oh, and `e-mail me <mailto:titus@idyll.org>`__ if you want the extension
module.  It's short and badly written, but it does work!

--titus

p.s. It does seem a mite silly to have to install pyxmpp, libxml2,
dnspython, m2crypto, *and* twill in order to send XMPP messages.  But
hey, that's OSS, right?
