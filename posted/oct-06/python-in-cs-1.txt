Using Python as the "CS 1" programming language
# tags python,learning

I was out at `Michigan State University <http//www.msu.edu/>`_
discussing a faculty appointment last week, and we continued to talk
about using Python for an introductory Computer Science class.

Two questions came up and I'm hoping to get an answer to both via
the LazyWeb:

 * Who else is doing it?  What other universities or colleges have
   switched to using Python as the very *first* language to be learned?

   I think we're especially interested in people's actual experiences,
   but we'd also like to just find out who is using Python.

 * Books.  What good books are available for intro CS in Python?

   Looking on the `IntroductoryBooks page <http://wiki.python.org/moin/IntroductoryBooks>`__, I see many books listed:

      - `Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=1887902996>`__

      - `How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0971677506>`__

      - `Learn to Program Using Python: A Tutorial for Hobbyists, Self-Starters, and All Who Want to Learn the Art of Computer Programming <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0201709384>`__

      - `Python How to Program <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0130923613>`__

      - `Python Programming for the Absolute Beginner <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=1592000738>`__

      - `Computer Programming is Fun! <http://www.handysoftware.com/cpif/>`__

      - `Python First: Introduction to Computing with Python <http://studypack.com/comp/mod/resource/view.php?id=2923>`__

Does anyone have personal experience with using these to teach?  Please
either `e-mail me <mailto:titus@caltech.edu>`_ or post a comment -- thanks!
