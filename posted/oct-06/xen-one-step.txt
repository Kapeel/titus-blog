Installing Xen on Debian
# tags debian,admin

I just got two HP ML350 servers (*very* nice: 8 gb RAM, 600 gb 15k
disk, 2x 3.6 GHz Xeon -- yes, we over-ordered) and I spent a few hours
installing Xen-enabled Debian on them.

`Xen <http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/srg/netos/xen/>`__ is a very
nice virtualization system that works with Linux.  It lets you do
things like run multiple virtual machines on top of Linux,
save/restore/checkpoint them, and migrate (live!) virtual machines
across physical machines.  I'm planning to use it to run some
Web servers & also to provide isolated development environments for
people who *absolutely* require root privs.  (Read this `Xen
documentation
<http://tx.downloads.xensource.com/downloads/docs/user/#SECTION01110000000000000000>`__
for some pretty clear overview docs on the commands available.)

After struggling for many hours, I got the Xen install down to 30
minutes.  The guide I found most useful was this article on `Debian
Sid gets Xen 3.0
<http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/396>`__ by Steve Kemp
(an advogatoan!), but the process is even simpler now: briefly,

 0. Install Debian minimal.

 1. Switch to 'unstable' in your apt sources.

 2. ``apt-get dist-upgrade``

 3. ``apt-get install xen-linux-system-2.6.18-1-xen-686``

 4. Do the rest of the apt-gets mentioned in the article above.

 5. ``apt-get install xen-tools``

 6. (If you want network bridging) Edit /etc/xen/xend-config.sxp and put
    ``(network-script network-bridge)`` in instead of ``network-dummy``.

 7. Reboot.

...and voila, you should be able to create Xen virtual machines with
xen-create-image!

Now hopefully I can set up some cheeseshop-based kwalitee testing in my
virtual machines...
