MichiPUG meeting
# tags python,testing

While in Lansing, Michigan last week, I used the `MichiPUG meeting
<http://www.michipug.org/index.cgi/FrontPage>`__ as an excuse to visit
Ann Arbor.  (Ann Arbor is nice!)  I presented `twill
<http://twill.idyll.org>`__, `scotch
<http://darcs.idyll.org/~t/projects/scotch/doc/>`__, and
`wsgi_intercept
<http://darcs.idyll.org/~t/projects/wsgi_intercept/README.html>`__.
I also met Kevin Dangoor and Jason Pellerin, people that I'd previously
only known online.

It was especially gratifying to be explicitly asked about
wsgi_intercept functionality by Kevin: after seeing twill, he asked if
it was possible to do in-process testing with it, and I whipped out
wsgi_intercept to show him that yes, yes, it was!

Bruce Webber also gave a nice intro to wxPython at the meeting.
