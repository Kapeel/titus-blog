Chairing a Web Panel at PyCon
# tags python

After learning from Jeff Rush that no one had volunteered (yet) to organize
a panel on Web technologies, I stepped up to the plate.  I've also
submitted a talk proposal about twill/scotch/figleaf and (with Grig)
I'm going to submit a proposal for a testing tutorial, so attendees may
well get tired of hearing my voice.  I would be happy if someone else
would volunteer to run the panel, hint, hint...

The panel I'm planning to organize is the `Web Frameworks panel
<http://us.pycon.org/TX2007/WebFrameworksPanel>`__.  The idea is to
get a few authors/maintainers of Web frameworks up on a podium and ask
them questions about their framework and its relations to other
frameworks.  A few questions are already up on the Web Frameworks panel
page.  It sounds like we might be able to score a lunch slot, too, given
sufficient effort.

I must admit to having a complete lapse of creativity at the moment,
so I'm hoping that I can solicit a few things from the Python community:

 - what web frameworks are you interested in seeing represented?
   (and who should I contact as the maintainer?)

 - what questions would you like to have asked?

 - what format do you think the panel should be?  Pre-selected questions,
   open floor, etc.?

Let me know...

thanks,
