What's a good Python code base?
# tags python

A friend asks, ::

  i'm going to be recoding <x> from scratch starting next week, in python.
  what codebase would you recommend as good to model after?

Any thoughts on a well-formed, reasonably sized (yet not huge), and simple
Python code base?

There have to be some examples somewhere!  I'd suggest something in the stdlib,
but nothing is coming to mind right now -- and there are some real stinkers in
there, too.

For now, I've pointed my friend towards PEP 8 and the Python Cookbook.  Very
unsatisfying.
