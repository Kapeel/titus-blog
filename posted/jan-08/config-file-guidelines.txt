Dear Lazyweb: Config file guidelines?
# tags python,lazyweb

Tracy recently asked me if there were any good guidelines about how to
write configuration files -- not coding-level guidelines, but guidelines
on structure and content.

I was unable to come up with anything: my Google-fu failed me, and my
DevonThink database was silent (although it did have some nice testing
articles, which I of course forwarded on to her).

I must admit to a general mental block on the subject of how to write
config files.  How do you choose the right balance between
configurability and complexity?  What about language -- should they be
native Perl/Python/whatnot (Tracy's package is for programmers) or is
there a benefit to embracing the mental overhead of config file parsing?

Thoughts and pointers appreciated, either in comments or `via email
<mailto:titus@idyll.org>`__.
