Testing for sysadmins -- monitoring your infrastructure
# tags python,twill,testing

Noah and Grig have been CCing me on a conversation about `JoelOnChecklists
<http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2008/01/22.html>`__ and `Grig's
post
<http://agiletesting.blogspot.com/2008/01/joel-on-checklists.html>`__.
Noah's writing a book chapter on this stuff, and asked for some tips.

Here are mine.

===========

First, I have a bunch of individual twill scripts in a directory that
are run every hour.  These scripts are mostly of the form, ::

  % cat neuro-is-alive
  go http://neuro.caltech.edu/
  code 200

  find "Shimojo"

That is, they verify that the host is alive, successfully serving
content, and serving content with the right keyword.

I run them from cron: ::

        10 * * * * /usr/bin/twill-sh /u/t/.tests/* > /dev/null

and they have been invaluable for telling me when machines are broken.
Obviously they don't replace "proper" monitoring software, but they do
detect downtime, misconfigurations, etc. -- and they're *really* cheap
to write/update/disable.  (Remember, folk, KISS...)

============

Second, I use twill to test my DNS setup.  I have a few scripts that
are run hourly (see mechanism above) against both my master name server
and the public caching name servers provided by my ISP: ::

  extend_with dns_check
  dns_a alife.org. 134.10.15.75 $dns_server

This gives me security that my entire DNS system is working, and also
lets me do "test-driven name service", where I can write the test first
("I want the A record for alife.org to point to X.Y.Z"), then write the
bind config & verify that it works.

I think I have managed to mildly annoy my ISP a few times by asking why
their name servers were returning bad or outdated or inconsistent
information ;)

=============

Third, to test mailman installs and the queue runner (which has a habit of
dying on my machine ;(:

I set up the following: one of my machines sends a message to a mailman
list, which forwards to a single alias file, which in turn saves the
message to a Web-accessible location.  The saved message is wiped each
time a new message is sent.

Another machine checks that Web-accessible location for correct content
using the twill tests (above).

It will fail if the saved message is ever not wiped -- I didn't bother
putting a time stamp in ;) -- but this gives me some security that I
will detect system-wide mailman failures in the future.

This test setup also serves as a fairly simple test of e-mail
configuration and delivery.

I think I can simplify this third test by adding some sendmail
commands into twill that allow sending of an e-mail containing a
unique identifier, followed by a check of the list archive mbox.
I'd have to write new code for that, though, and the above fits my needs.

==============

These simple tests really keep my machines on the straight-and-narrow.
Since I run most of this stuff for fun and not for profit, this simple
and easily maintainable system test infrastructure is all I really need.
