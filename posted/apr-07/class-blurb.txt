Intermediate and Advanced Software Carpentry with Python
# tags python, teaching

(Here's the blurb that I came up with for my Advanced SWC class.  This
*particular* class instance isn't open to the public, but I'm not
averse to giving it again.

--titus)

What you will learn:

* how to use and extend builtin advanced types in Python;
* how to lay out code for ease of maintenance, reusability, and testability;
* how to profile for performance bottlenecks and improve performance with
    extensions and threading;
* how to start using the wide variety of external packages that are
    useful for scientists, including plotting and data analysis tools
    such as matplotlib, SciPy, IDLE, MPI, and Rpy;
* make your data more accessible to yourself and others with databases
    and Web presentation tools;

Course benefits:

The Python programming language contains an immense number of features
that are extraordinarily useful to scientific programmers and readily
accessible to intermediate level developers.  This course will provide
an introduction to many of these features, focusing on those that will
make your Python programs more maintainable, testable, accurate, and
faster.  This course will also introduce a number of third-party
packages for development, plotting, and data-analysis that are
particularly useful to scientists.

Who should attend:

Scientists who use Python for data processing, data analysis, data
presentation, data management, or working with external code and
libraries.  An introductory knowledge of Python is assumed, as are
basic concepts in object-oriented programming.

Hands-on training:

Exercises throughout this course offer immediate, hands-on reinforcement
of the ideas you are learning.  Exercises include:

* recipes for interacting with advanced Python builtin types;
* refactoring example programs for better code reuse and testing;
* writing unit tests, doc tests, and functional tests for existing code;
* enhancing data processing performance with psyco, pyrex, and C extensions;
* refactoring C extension code to support multithreading;
* graphing data in matplotlib;
* working with MPI in Python;
* practical work with the IDLE IDE;
* interacting with a large database via the Web;
* building a simple graphical interface for data analysis;
