Seeking: independent study student for tech reporting on Python
# tags python,msu

I'd like to find an MSU student to report semi-monthly on python-dev.
The student would be responsible for monitoring the python-dev mailing
list and active PEPs, summarizing substantive discussions in a public
forum, and integrating feedback from the community.  This would be a 1
credit CSE independent study course (CSE 490).  Additional effort (for
more credits) could be applied towards building and maintaining a CMS
site to store and reference past and present summaries, or integrating
reviews of new modules.

The ideal student would be someone who communicates well in writing,
is interested in technical reporting, and has some basic experience
with programming.  Python experience (CSE 231) is a plus.

Please send a brief summary of interests together with a sample of
writing to ctb@msu.edu.
