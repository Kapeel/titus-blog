pinocchio 0.1 is released
# tags python,testing

Michal Kwiatkowski and I just released `pinocchio 0.1
<http://darcs.idyll.org/~t/projects/pinocchio/doc/>`__, a collection
of plugins for `nose
<http://somethingaboutorange.com/mrl/projects/nose/>`__.  It's got
my `figleaf section recording plugin, figleafsections <http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/feb-07/figleaf-goodness>`__, and it's also got Michal's spec plugin,
which lets you write tests like this: ::

  class TestFoobar:
      def test_is_a_singleton(self):
          pass
      def test_can_be_automatically_documented(self):
          pass

which, during the test run, will generate the following output: ::

  Foobar
  - is a singleton
  - can be automatically documented

i.e. it will generate a "specification".

Pretty cool, eh?

Anyway, check it out if you like neat little hacks.
