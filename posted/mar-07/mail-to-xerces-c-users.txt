An e-mail to the Xerces c-users mailing list

If anyone knows someone actually *on* the Xerces c-users mailing list or
development team, could you please forward this on?

(I sent it directly to the list mentioned on
http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/feedback.html, but it hasn't shown up in the
archives and I don't seem to have received a bounceback.  I'm guessing that I
can't post to the list without moderation because I'm not a member of the list,
but I can't see any obvious way to sign up for the mailing list.  At this point
I'm worried it has simply vanished into the ether; hence this post.)

  Hi folks,

  I thought you might find my discussion of how to compile Xerces-C++ into
  Mac OS X universal binaries useful:  

        http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/mar-07/compiling-x-platform-on-macs.html

  The two pertinent sections are #2 (proper runConfigure incantations) and
  3(a) (linking the installed libxerces libraries into Mac OS X's
  development hierarchy).  3(c) (distributing dylibs with your app) is
  also extremely useful.

  Someone should obviously verify all of this before putting it into the
  docs; if someone else can verify it, I'd be happy to write it up in the
  appropriate format and contribute it as a patch to Xerces-C.  Just ask
  ;).

  cheers,

  p.s. The reason I'd like someone *else* to verify it is that I've   
  fiddled with various paths on my laptop and no longer have a clean       
  environment within which to test instructions.  I'm pretty sure I got    
  all of the steps, but it'd be nice to have someone else check.

I continually have problems figuring out how to get e-mail through to projects.
*grumble*  Ahh well.
