``unittest`` bitching: premature; lazyweb request
# tags python

From reading `Collin Winter's blog
<http://oakwinter.com/code/a-new-unittest/>`__ he's designing a new
``unittest`` module *first*, and *then* he's going to ask c.l.p and
presumably python-dev about adding it to py3k.  So it's not quite the
fait accompli I thought it was, which reduces my complaints to mild
grumbling.

And, dear lazyweb... is there a good way to find out when a particular
line of code was introduced (or last touched) through subversion?

thanks,
