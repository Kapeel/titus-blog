Five Things I Hate About Python

`Brian D. Foy claims
<http://use.perl.org/~brian_d_foy/journal/32556?from=rss>`__ that if
you want to be an effective advocate for a language, you need to be
able to answer the question, "What are five things you hate about it?"

Hmm, lessee.  I actually have a tough time coming up with five things
off the top of my head, but:

 1. The 'import' command, 'sys.path' modification semantics, and the
    whole "shadow module" import optimization.  It's all just ugly.

 2. Threading, the global interpreter lock, and multiprocessing.  Ugly
    (but beautiful, too; Guido's right when he says writing C
    extensions would be *miserable* w/o the GIL).

 3. The (dis)-organization of the stdlib.  I can't find a damn thing
    in there without already knowing that it exists, and then when I
    do find it the documentation is invariably confusing and poorly
    laid out.  (As an extreme example, try using the subprocess module
    to do, well, anything.  Even if you have a reasonably good
    knowledge of OS behavior, you have to flip back and forth between
    about five doc pages to figure out how to use the module.)  The
    stdlib is still great -- it actually *has* most things! -- but it
    is also frustrating.

 4. The patch mafia.  I like everyone on python-dev that I meet, but
    somehow it is annoyingly difficult to get a patch into Python.
    Like threading, and the stdlib, this is a mixed blessing: you
    certainly don't want every Joe Schmoe checking in whatever crud he
    wants.  However, the barrier is high enough that I no longer have
    much interest in spending the time to shepherd a patch through.
    Yes, this is probably all my fault -- but I still hate it!

 5. easy_install doesn't work on enough packages.  easy_install is
    $DEITY's gift to admins, but it doesn't work on a number of packages.
    This is usually some combination of (a) poor package structure,
    (b) C/C++ code compilation requirements on systems where I don't
    have a C/C++ compiler (i.e. Windows ;), and (c) failure to post
    the package on PyPI.

    I have some ideas (in line with Grig's Cheesecake project) on how
    to start fixing #5, so that's where I'm going to start ;).

So these are the five things that come to my mind when I want to bitch
about Python.

At the risk of starting an out-of-control meme... what are the five things
YOU most hate about Python?
