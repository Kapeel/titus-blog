Which functional programming language(s) should we teach?
# tags python,msu,cse

Laurie Dillon just posted the SIGPLAN eduction board article on `Why
Undergraduates Should Learn the Principles of Programming Languages
<http://mt4.acm.org/educationboard/2010/06/why-undergraduates-should-learn-the-principles-of-programming-languages.html>`__
to our faculty mailing list at the `MSU Computer Science department
<http://www.cse.msu.edu>`__.  One question that came up in the ensuing
conversation was: what functional programming language(s) would/should
we teach?

I mentioned OCaml, Haskell, and Erlang as reasonably pure but still
pragmatic FP languages.  Anything else that's both "truly" functional
and used somewhat broadly in the real world?

thanks!
