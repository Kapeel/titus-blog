Perl programmers are from Mars, Python programmers are from Venus

Here's my dirty little secret: I read `PlanetPerl <http://planet.perl.org/>`__.

I do so for a couple of reasons.  First, there are a number of good programmers
that post through it.  Second, I'm easily amused by any discussion of Perl 6.
And third, occasionally my mind gets boggled.

Take, for example, `Ovid's post
<http://use.perl.org/~Ovid/journal/31672?from=rss>`__ on the `MIT
switch to Python <http://www-tech.mit.edu/V125/N65/coursevi.html>`__.
The primary post itself is silly enough -- Guido doesn't like lambda,
so Guido has serious limitations in his thought process, so Python is
a lousy language -- but some of the comments are even worse, IMO.  The
comments boil down to "programming is hard, so we should make programs
hard to read". I herewith retaliate: ::

   Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first
   place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible,
   you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.

       --Brian W. Kernighan

I wholeheartedly agree with the `SICP statement
<http://weblog.raganwald.com/2006/10/irony.html>`__ that "Programs
must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines
to execute."  I don't really see any irony in SICP containing this
statement, either; programmers *should* know basic math and lambda
calculus, I think, but that's different from making your programs
hard to understand.

In fact, my personal programming motto has become "strive for
simplicity", because simple code is both easy to read and easy to
test, and therefore has a higher probability of being both correct and
maintainable.  Your mileage will not vary.
