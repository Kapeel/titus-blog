While on travels (visiting the `Computational Biology Initiative
<http://www.cbi.utsa.edu/about>`__ in San Antonio, Texas) I read two
fiction books that were a cut above my normal sci-fi and fantasy
reading material.

`The Geographer's Library
<http://www.amazon.com/Geographers-Library-Jon-Fasman/dp/1594200386>`__,
by Jon Fasman was an entertaining read about alchemists.  It took the
same sort of pseudo-intellectual approach to fictionalizing history
as The Da Vinci Code.  Enjoyable puff.  Well written.

The other book was Zadie Smith's book `On Beauty <http://www.amazon.com/Beauty-Zadie-Smith/dp/0143037749/>`__, which was the "heavier" of the two books.
It was apparently a serious contender for the Booker Prize.  I personally
found it a bit too entangled in academic nonsense; the writing was good,
but the story was painful and annoying, and I couldn't appreciate the writing
because the story got in the way.
