Darned Apache2
# tags admin

Spent a really frustrating hour or two this weekend figuring out why
Apache 2.1 wasn't working on vallista.idyll.org.

The symptoms of the problem were that Apache would not serve static
pages *at all*.  I could serve dynamic pages (in fact, I "patched"
my few static sites by turning XBitHack On so that they would be
served as INCLUDE files) but I couldn't serve any static files.
.html files, .css files, .jpg/.png files: all would come up blank.
Literally, blank: Apache was serving no content whatsoever.

I finally figured out that files above 255 bytes in size were being
truncated at 0 bytes, which led me (via Google) to `this post
<http://dev.cotni.org/journal/?cat=6>`__.  Turns out that ``sendfile``
apparently doesn't work on *my* VPS, either.  Grr.

So basically I blew a huge amount of time on a silly little problem.  Sounds
like sysadminning to me...

The end result, however, was that I reduced my standing memory usage from
over 375 mb to under 210 mb by switching from multiple SCGI servers to
multiple FCGI servers.  Good stuff.
