Seen on a Ruby On Rails IRC channel
# tags python

There was another mildly amusing incident during the `recent SoCal
Piggies meeting
<http://agiletesting.blogspot.com/2007/07/your-purpose-is-python-group.html>`__.

Michael Carter was showing us his incredibly neat Web 3.0 / HTTP PUSH
software, `orbited <http://brbx.com/orbited/>`__, by demoing an
interactive IRC client on the Web.  He signed onto the ruby-on-rails
IRC channel and (this being a Python meeting) asked "Is Python better
than Ruby?"

The response, interestingly enough, was (and I paraphrase): "No.  Ruby
is more modern, and because it doesn't use whitespace, you don't have
to use templates."

Well, that didn't make any sense to me, so I asked Michael to follow
up with "what are templates?"

Next response? "In Python/Django, you need to use templates because Python
isn't good for this stuff."

heh.

p.s. Should I hedge?  Sure.  "No, I don't think every Ruby person is
so silly as to conflate 'Ruby' with 'Ruby on Rails' or 'Python' with
'Django'."
