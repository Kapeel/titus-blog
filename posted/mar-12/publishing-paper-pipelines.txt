Where should I put scripts for a paper?
# tags science,bioinformatics,khmer

I'm putting together a computational pipeline for a paper - a Makefile
that runs a ton of stuff and outputs files, combined with an ipython
notebook file that takes those output files and turns them into
figures for inclusion in a LaTeX file.  (Yes, very 2000, except for the
ipython notebook which is bleeding edge.)

As we all do, I've written a bunch of paper-specific scripts to process data
and otherwise munge stuff together.  The paper is based on my khmer project,
but the scripts are paper-spec they may morph into something more
project-general.

So where should I put them?

Specifically, should I --

- check them into the paper repository, and make them part of the paper build process?

- check them into the software repository?

- make a special-purpose github repo for them?

My hesitation about combining them with the paper repo is that I write papers
on my laptop and run compute elsewhere, so in my mind they don't belong
together.  Off the top of my head it seems like the best option, though.

If I put them in the software repository, then they will go stale unless I
integrate them into the automated tests.  For that matter, I could put the
paper in the software repo, too, but either way the automated tests for these
scripts will introduce a lot of new and tangential dependencies into the main
software repo.

If I put them in a special-purpose github repo, then they will go stale but
nobody will really care :).  And they will be lost for all eternity.  Which
might be ok.

Does anyone have any experience with this kind of thing?  My last such
scripts+pub effort was before I got the automated testing bug...

(I think we need an "ask the compusciencegeek" service...)
