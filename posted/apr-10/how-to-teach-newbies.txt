How to teach newbies about Python
# tags python,idiocy

Inspired by the brilliant mind(s) behind `python-commandments.org <http://python-commandments.org/>`__, here's a list of ideas you can use to help newbies
learn Python!

1. Write Web pages with overly broad self-granted authority.  That way they'll
   sound authoritative!

2. Make sure they're anonymous pages, too.  It's important that people
   not recognize that "Commandment" means "My Opinion", especially in the
   presence of actual `Python community-level commandments <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum>`__.  You know, like "we're switching to Python 3".
   
3. Keep it short.  Nobody wants to overwhelm people with, umm, information.

4. Have a favorite toolkit?  Push it!

5. Oh, wait -- does your favorite toolkit only really address one particular
   problem?  That's OK!  Naive technical discussions are *just fine* --
   opinions only, information just gets in the way!

6. Remember, keep that self-authority coming!

Seriously, I gather that these are the folk helping out on the #python channel
on IRC.  Gawd help us.

p.s. I stumbled across it when someone pointed it out to me as a reason
to not prioritize Python 3 for a GSoC project.
