Off to Michigan again.
# tags python,msu,travel

I'm going to be visiting Michigan for a conference (on `Mackinaw
Island`_) at the end of September, where I'll be talking about my
thesis research.  Following said conference, I'll be hanging out at
Michigan State U. for the week of Oct 2-6; I'll be giving a talk on
Agile Testing and Domain Specific Languages for the CSE department and
a similar talk on Python and Agile Software Development for the ACM CS
club.  I'm also going to try to make it over to Ann Arbor for the
monthly Michigan Python Users Group meeting; I'm in contact with
Kevin Dangoor about giving a presentation or sumthin'.

Quite a trip!
