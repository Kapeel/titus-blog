Commenting functionality.
# tags python,pyblosxom

Ok, I've just enabled my ``ocomments`` plugin for pyblosxom_ on this blog.

``ocomments`` is a hacked version of the ``comments`` plugin that keeps
track of users and lets me approve users and posts individually.  Hopefully
it will let me keep the blog spam free while letting regular posters
comment freely.

Eventually I'll add some features so that regular posters can also approve
posts, but that's down the road a bit.
