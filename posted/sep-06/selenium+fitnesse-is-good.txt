Selenium/FitNesse testing
=========================

Grig and the agile-testing list both sent me some interesting testing
links today.

foo gui writes in `Integrating Selenium IDE/RC and FitNesse`_ about a
neat trick where UI tests can be run via Selenium from FitNesse.  (The
subtitle is "Automated Web Testing Bliss" ;)

Jeremy Miller discusses `Creating a testing DSL with FitNesse and
Selenium`_, wherein he uses FitNesse fixtures to create a domain
specific language (DSL) for their applications.  He nicely sums up the
desire for testing DSLs in one sentence: *There's a lot of buzz lately
over the creation of Domain Specific Languages (DSL), driven in no
small part to create a syntax for the application code that is
readable by the business partners and testers.*

And to complete the Selenium/FitNesse trifecta, Debora Hartmann posted
about STIQ_, another FitNesse/Selenium combo.

It's an interesting irony that a company I've been working with
adopted twill_ over Selenium because (among other reasons) it was much
easier to integrate twill with FitNesse...

On the subject of twill...
==========================

Even though I took a two-month hiatus from twill, the bug reports &
feature requests kept on rolling in!  I'm hoping to catch up someday
soon.

Dear Lazyweb...
===============

I vaguely recall a very funny cartoon about the software design process,
with a rope/tire swing that was sold by a salesman, designed by a software
architect, implemented by a programmer, etc.  I'd like to use it in a talk
about agile testing.  Anyone have the URL?  Drop me_ a line - thanks!
