Twitter Ho!
# tags python,pycon

OK, I'm going to try out twitter for the first time, in order to see if it
works out at PyCon for keeping track of what's going on and letting people
know what I'm up to.  I guess you have to e-mail me to get in touch with me,
though, as I'm not following anyone (and I don't expect to keep using twitter
after PyCon).

Anyway, my twitterifick name (twitter handle?) is ctitusbrown.  Boring
as you'd expect.
