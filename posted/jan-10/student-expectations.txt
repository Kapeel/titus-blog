Managing student expectations for open-source projects
# tags python,teaching

On the heels of my `aggressive competence post
<http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/dec-09/aggressive-competence.html>`__,
about (among other things) my failure to outline my expectations for students,
I've started putting together a page to help manage student expectations for
the pony-build project, which is participating in `the Undergraduate Capstone
Open-Source Projects (UCOSP) course <http://ucosp.wordpress.com>`__ this
term.

(Please comment over at the Wordpress blog for UCOSP:

so the students can see your words of wisdom!)
