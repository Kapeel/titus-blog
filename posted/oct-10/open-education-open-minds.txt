Open Education, Open Minds, but No Communication?
# tags snark,education

PLoS Biology published an article entitled
`Open Education, Open Minds <http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1000508>`__, in which they solicited ideas for
contributions to a series on life sciences education: 

   Contributions to the Education Series are encouraged; ideas should be sent to plosbiology@plos.org.

So I sent in an e-mail and got back ::

Hmm.  Either they have a very intelligent spam filter that filters on
content relevance to the Open Education series (and I failed the
filter), or they failed to actually try sending themselves e-mail...

--titus

(This was duplicated by someone else, sending from a different e-mail
server.  So it's not just me.)
