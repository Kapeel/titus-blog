Lazyweb query: CloudStore (or KosmosFS)
# tags python,cloud

Does anyone have any experience with CloudStore, formerly known as
KosmosFS?  From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CloudStore: ::

  CloudStore (KFS, previously Kosmosfs) is Kosmix's C++ implementation of
  Google File System. ... CloudStore supports incremental scalability,
  replication, checksumming for data integrity, client side fail-over and access
  from C++, Java and Python.

The project site is here: http://kosmosfs.sourceforge.net/

I'd be interested in comments on general usability, quality, and "feel"...

thanks!
