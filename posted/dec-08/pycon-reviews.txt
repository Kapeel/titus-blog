PyCon review process
# tags python,pycon,academia

We're going through the PyCon '09 review process, and participating in the
process has been pretty interesting.  (I joined the Program Committee in large
part because I was told to put up or shut up after I critiqued PyCon '08.
Ahh, the open source world... where you're encouraged to go fix things when you
complain :). In particular, this is the first review process I've seen where
regular communication between the reviewers and authors is expected, and
proposals are modified in response to reviewer comments.

There are a couple of drawbacks to this process.  One is that there's no clear
boundary between reviewer opinion and expectation.  It's one thing to say "I
don't understand X, Y, or Z in your proposal; could you clarify, please?" and
another to say "I don't agree with X, Y, or Z, and I won't push your proposal
unless you change your views."  The former seems pretty legit, but the latter
strikes me as being counter to the conference ethos of encouraging diversity in
views.  While I don't think anyone has been that explicit, there have been
extensive conversations between reviewers and authors that have had much the
same effect...

Another drawback of this system is that authors can express their frustration
at reviewer comments pretty directly.  Sometimes this frustration is legit, but
other times it's hysterically off-base; you don't make any friends when you
tell your reviewers that they're idiots (just as one **purely hypothetical**
example...)

On the flip side, I think several proposals have been dramatically improved
through reviewer feedback.  I don't know how well this kind of insta-review
process might work for academic journals -- I believe PLoS One is trying it out?
-- and I'll be watching some of the early experiments with interest.

Paranthetically, let me add that we have a bunch of great proposals,
and Ivan Krstic is doing a fantastic job of running things!  So I expect PyCon
'09 to be a very good conference.
