Perl is Dying?
# tags python

Some interesting posts over in Planet Perl:

 - `Perl 5 is Dying <http://use.perl.org/~Ovid/journal/38010>`__
 - `So What (are you going to do about it)? <http://use.perl.org/~chromatic/journal/38016?from=rss>`__
 - `Perl 5 Programmers are Dying <http://use.perl.org/~Ovid/journal/38018?from=rss>`__

While I'm a raging Python fanatic (or at least a serious Python user
:) I don't think this is anything to gloat about: Perl vs Python
is a relatively minor struggle compared to Good Language vs PHP, and
Dynamic vs Static.

Either way there are good lessons for any language in there.  And we
should be sure to thank GvR, Barry Warsaw, and all the other Py3k
contributors for moving forward with Py3k... Say what you will about
Py3K's backwards incompatibility, but I think the lack of a strongly
determined future for Perl, i.e. a clear roadmap for Perl 6, is one of
the Perl community's big problems.
