What have I been up to?
# tags python,testing,science

As a `new prof <http://ged.msu.edu/>`__, I've been too busy to blog
much.  What am I doing?

Apart from all the normal academic crud (meeting with people, answering e-mail,
doing paperwork, etc.) and parenting & home ownership stuff, I've been teaching
my `Intro to Database-Backed Web Programming course
<http://ged.msu.edu/courses/2008-fall-cse-491/>`__. This has been neither a
huge failure nor a huge success, but has at least been extremely educational
for me (did I mention that jQuery is awesome?).  That's consumed most of my
time.

However, I do have a few technical things up my sleeve.  Over Thanksgiving,
I've been --

 - looking over a student's work on seqdb2, a Write-Once-Read-Many database
   for indexing and retrieving large DNA and protein sequence collections (e.g.
   Solexa reads).  It's somewhat specifically aimed at providing a
   `pygr back-end <http://code.google.com/p/pygr>`__ to help us manage the
   startlingy large amount of sequence data now available.

 - starting to get into SeqFinder, an n-mer indexing and search library
   for doing O(n) searching for n-length oligos in gigabase-sized genomes.
   The basic algorithm is simple and fairly straightforward, but the devil
   is in the details; a collaborator is implementing it, and I'm hoping to
   turn it into a fairly general oligo search tool for several nefarious
   purposes.

 - and, of perhaps the most general interest, I'm trying to grok
   `Pyrex <http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/greg.ewing/python/Pyrex/>`__
   sufficiently to add code coverage recording and analysis.  Since
   pygr, seqdb2, and SeqFinder all make use of Pyrex or its fork,
   `Cython <http://cython.org/>`__, this is critical for me for testing.  I
   suspect it will be quite useful to the SciPy folk as well, once I get it
   working nicely.

   I do have something that basically works, but it's not integrated into
   either Pyrex or figleaf very well yet and I need to hack on it a bit further.

   My ultimate goal is to get coverage data from Python, Pyrex/Cython, and
   C/C++ all in one format so that I can do a proper job of looking at
   statement coverage for these multi-language applications.  That's still
   a ways off, and one of the bigger barriers is that gcov doesn't work on
   shared libraries.  Grr.

Hopefully I can spend some more time on these things now that the term is
almost over!
