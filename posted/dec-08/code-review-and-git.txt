Lazyweb query: code review and git?
# tags python

The pygr project is gearing up to do some code reviews, and we're not
aware of too many (any?) mature (or even adolescent) tools that
interact well with git.  A Google search finds `Gerrit
<http://android.git.kernel.org/?p=tools/gerrit.git;a=summary>`__ and
`a blog post about Code Review
<http://community.livejournal.com/evan_tech/252161.html>`__ --
anything else we should know about?

thanks,
--titus

p.s. If you `e-mail me <t@idyll.org>`__ I will summarize here; or you
can comment, but I might lose your comment in all the spam :(
