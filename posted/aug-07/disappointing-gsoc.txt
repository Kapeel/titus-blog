A disappointing SoC experience
# tags python

I was the official mentor for a Google Summer of Code student this
year -- Martin van Loewis was "technical mentor" -- and I found it to
be a disappointing experience.  At the beginning, I felt guilty about
not being more on the ball about pushing the student to do more work;
by the end, it became clear that whatever the student's original
intentions had been, this project was certainly not their priority.

Next time, I will inform the student(s) of my expectations upfront;
insist on weekly status reports, however short; expect to see working,
tested code checked in to a public repository; and, if these
expectations are not met, the student will not be paid for the first
half of the summer.  (If they *are* met, the student can expect (at
the minimum) positive recommendation letters from me, on top of the
salary.)

More generally, I would suggest that people not take GSoC students
with whom they have had no prior contact, unless those students are
local and can be pressured with direct social interaction ;).  Oh,
that, and don't accept proposals that are inaccurate with respect to
technical details: the odds are against those people actually
*learning* the technical stuff.

I don't regret signing up for this -- it was a learning experience -- but
I regret that the opportunity was wasted, for the PSF, for Google, and
for the student.
