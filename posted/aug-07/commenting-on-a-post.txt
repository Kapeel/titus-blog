I wanted to write a comment on `timing unittests <http://renesd.blogspot.com/2007/08/timing-and-unittests-graphing-speed.html>`__, but that blog does not allow anonymous comments and there is no obvious place to e-mail the author.

Bummer.

(The short version of my comment is that getting the basic data out with something like nose is trivial; see my pinocchio extensions.)
