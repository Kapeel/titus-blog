A reply to Elanthis: Python Annoyances
# tags python

In reply to `elanthis's post <http://www.advogato.org/person/elanthis/diary/384.html>`__ on Advogato,

1.  I agree that the documentation could be improved, and we've been
working on it.  The next release should add a whole bunch of examples.
Google is your friend, as is the Python Cookbook.

2. Files as modules.  What about importing those symbols in the package __init__.py? e.g.

  foo/some/other/package/blah.py:
    class MyClass:
       ...

  foo/__init__.py
       from foo.some.other.package.blah import MyClass

The physical layout is for you, the developer, while the exposed
package interface can be pretty much whatever you want.

3. Classes are weak: yes, I guess so, but I don't really know how to
address your concerns without adding a lot of syntax.  Are you just
lusting after variable declarations 'cause that's how you think?

Your take on unit testing seems just plain wrong.  I know of no useful
language that can prevent the majority of programming errors without
some form of actually running the code, a.k.a. "testing".  You might think
YMMV, but you're almost certainly wrong.

4. I agree that the decorator syntax is inelegant and inconsistent.

5. No variable declaration: you'd catch most of these problems with
even the most rudimentary of unit tests and code coverage analysis.
Shadowing is a concern, though.  In practice it's never caused problems
for me.

6. There are official recommendations regarding docstrings; see `PEP
257 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/>`__.  The (new) Python
documentation is formatted with Sphinx, which you might like better.

I think you have a good point or two, but I also think you need to
spend some more time programming in Python to figure out which of your
complaints are actual problems with Python and what is simply a legacy
of bad habits garnered from experiences with other languages.  Even if
you abandon Python for another dynamic language, I think you'll have
the same (or stronger) criticisms of those.

cheers,
