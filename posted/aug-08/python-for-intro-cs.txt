Python for Intro CS?
#tags python

I'm surprised I haven't seen this on planetpython yet...

   ...an emerging consensus in the scripting community holds that
   **Python is the right solution for freshman programming**.  Ruby would
   also be a defensible choice.

(emphasis mine).  Originally found via `Lambda the Ultimate
<http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/2941>`__, and also passed onto me
by Rich Enbody.

In other news, there are some rumors coming out of the intro CS course
(CSE 231/232) here at Michigan State that the switch to Python from
C++ for the first term, 231, didn't affect the students' performance
in the follow-on course, 232.  That is, students performed equally
well on the 232 final independently of whether or not they'd had
Python or C++ in 231.  I had hoped for an *improvement* in the scores,
but at least it's not a decline!
