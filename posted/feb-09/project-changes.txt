Some project changes
# tags python,figleaf,scotch,twill

I'm switching several projects from darcs to either git on github, or svn on
Google Code.

`twill <http://twill.idyll.org/>`__, a simple Web testing tool/HTTP driver in
Python, was switched over to Google Code several months ago: see
`http://code.google.com/p/twill <http://code.google.com/p/twill>`__.  I'll post
more on twill development soon, I hope.

I just put `scotch <http://darcs.idyll.org/~t/projects/scotch/>`__
in the twill svn as well.  scotch is an HTTP recording and playback tool
written in Python with `WSGI interfaces
<http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/>`__.

I also moved `figleaf
<http://darcs.idyll.org/~t/projects/figleaf/README.html>`__ to github, at
`http://github.com/ctb/figleaf/tree/master
<http://github.com/ctb/figleaf/tree/master>`__. figleaf is a flexible code
coverage recording and analysis tool for Python.

This move will hopefully open up development a bit more; I've been inactive
for too long, and I feel that one obstacle to participation in these projects
has been my self-hosting of the DVCS archives in darcs.

Note, I will probably move pinocchio, pygr-draw, zounds, and blastparser over
to github as well, whenever I get around to it.  I'm planning to decomission my
darcs repository as I swizzle machines around while moving my virtual home over
to MSU; the URLs will still work for pulling, but I'm going to stop pushing
things to them.
