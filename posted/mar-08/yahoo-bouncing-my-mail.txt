Yahoo is bouncing my mail server's e-mail.
# tags python
On top of dreamhost dropping off the 'net just when I posted a bunch of
screencasts... our socal-piggies meeting nearly got whacked because
this month's organizer uses Yahoo, and most of the messages going through
my mail server (which hosts the mailing list) were filed as "spam".

Now Yahoo is actively bouncing my e-mail.

... You can see for yourself that 69.55.232.123 isn't a known spam relay,
isn't open, etc.  It's just Yahoo looking at the volume of mail being
sent and going "hey! wait a sec!" and listing me as a spam host.

Grr.
