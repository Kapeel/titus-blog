PyCon Tip of the Day
# tags python

I'm at PyCon, and I have a tip for people: don't stay at the same
hotel as everyone else.

My hotel room Internet connection is *great*, perhaps in part because
I'm not sharing it with the rest of the PyCon attendees!  (Plus it's
free -- the DoubleTree wireless Internet doesn't charge you for a
connection, unlike the Crowne Plaza hotel that's hosting PyCon.)

I look forward to seeing everyone from last year & meeting new people;
look me up, guys!
