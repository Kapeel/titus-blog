GUI Testing

Kumar MacMillan pointed me towards `GUITAR
<http://www.cs.umd.edu/~atif/GUITARWeb/>`__, a framework built by
`Atif Memon <http://www.cs.umd.edu/~atif/newsite/index.htm>`__ and
others.  There's a `YouTube video
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiE9zRPD6ps>`__ of him and Adam Porter
talking at the Google Test Automation Conference (2007).

Looks and sounds interesting.  Also nice to note that `GUITAR is being
open-sourced <http://sourceforge.net/projects/guitar>`__...
