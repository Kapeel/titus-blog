Done!

Done.  DONE.  done.  Done done done done done.

I defended Sep 5th.  That went well.

Unfortunately I had lots of revisions to do.

That is finally finished: everyone signed off on the revisions.

If I don't officially have my nigh-irrevocable PhD by the new year,
it will be because of a paperwork malfunction, but for no other reason.
Hooray!

p.s. I'm up in San Francisco (well, Mountain View) through Thursday.
Anyone have any good ideas for what to do?  e.g.  a tour of Guido van
Rossum's office at Google? ;)  `E-mail me <mailto:titus@caltech.edu>`__.
