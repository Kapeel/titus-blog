C++ for Python Programmers: a Cheatsheet
# tags python, c++, msu

A fellow prof here at MSU, Rich Enbody, whipped up the following cheat-sheet
for new programmers transitioning from Python (CSE 231) to C++ (CSE 232).
He welcomes comments.  Here's the link:

    http://web.cse.msu.edu/~cse231/python2Cpp.html

Paranthetically, he and his cohort in crime, Bill Punch, will be giving a talk
about using Python as the intro CS programming language at PyCon '09.  They
have some interesting stats on the effects of a mixed Python-C++ curriculum
vs a C++-C++ course base for the first year of programming.

And folks... remember, this is for *intro* programmers who don't know
C++ yet!
