PyCon Web Panel Thoughts
# tags python,pycon07

First, let me mention that I've recruited Duncan McGreggor to the panel
to talk about twisted.web and Nevow.  That makes it a real party!  In random order, we now have:

 * Zope: Jim Fulton

 * Pylons: Ben Bangert

 * Django: Adrian Holovaty

 * CherryPy: Robert Brewer

 * TurboGears: Kevin Dangoor

 * pyjamas: James Tauber

 * twisted.web/Nevow: Duncan McGreggor

Now, as Ian point out in the comments on my last `PyCon Web Panel post
<http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/feb-07/pycon-web-panel.html>`__, the
questions on my `original announcement
<http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/oct-06/pycon-web-panel.html>`__ are
pretty insipid and will likely lead to a boring panel.

So, courtesy of our SoCal Piggies members, and David Pollak's `Web Framework Manifest <http://blog.lostlake.org/index.php?/archives/16-Web-Framework-Manifesto.html>`__, here are some slightly more pointed questions.

Can be asked of anyone:

 * why does your framework exist, given that so many others already exist?

 * what future does your Web framework have?

 * what sort of testing hooks have you made available?

 * what's the best Web framework?  ok, yours -- but the next best is...?

 * what's your favorite dead Python Web app/framework/approach?

 * before you wrote/got involved in developing your own Web framework,
   what frameworks did you use?

 * what impact has WSGI had on the way you think about extending your
   Web framework?

Specific framework/person questions:

 * Zope/Twisted: your community seems fairly insular. Is this true?
   (Assume yes.)  Is it by design?  If so, why; if not, what do you
   think are the causes and do you want to change it (and, if so, how;
   if not, why not?)?

 * Robert Brewer: last year you'd just debugged a nasty threading
   problem in CherryPy, and you promised me you'd have a solution for
   debugging Web server/load testing/threading problems of problem by
   PyCon '07.  Now I've got you in front of several hundred people --
   what was the problem? do you have a general testing/debugging solution?
   what is it?

 * pyjamas: JavaScript is quickly gaining more and more toolkits.  Why does
   yours exist?  Where do you plan to go with it?  What Web servers does it
   work well with?

OK, I'm out of creativity for the evening.  Does anyone have any
suggestions?  Remember, the object is to ask interesting questions
that will have *both* entertaining and *informative* responses.  In
particular, I'm not going to ask a question that will get me beaten ;).

I'm also still a bit stuck on the format.  I'd like to do some sort of
introduction, but that will take up a fair bit of time.  I'd also like
to have audience participation.  Blech.  We only have 45 minutes... Thoughts?
