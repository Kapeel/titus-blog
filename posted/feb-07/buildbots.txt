Buildbots Galore
# tags python,programming

I've finally got a buildbot that compiles `FamilyRelationsII <http://cartwheel.idyll.org/>`__ on Linux and Windows/cygwin, and I've got another buildbot
running tests for `twill <http://twill.idyll.org>`__,
`scotch <http://darcs.idyll.org/~t/projects/scotch/README.html>`__, and
`figleaf <http://darcs.idyll.org/~t/projects/figleaf/README.html>`__ on
Linux and Windows.

The convenience of this cannot be overestimated: I no longer need to
boot Windows in order to compile or test my software, and I can
compile my Linux software on a machine separate from my (no doubt
highly munged) development environment.  Whenever I make changes, I
just need to go look at a Web site to see what I screwed up ;).

Both the Linux and Windows machines are running inside of VMware.
Despite my strong OSS leanings, I've been very happy with VMware,
which is considerably advanced over Xen.  The VMware feature that sealed the
deal was the ability to use Python to control processes on the VM
machines, which is something I'll need down the road.  Someone let me know
when Xen gains this feature, yeh?

I'm still working on getting an OS X build slave going.  The OS X VMware
image that's floating around is (a) illegit and (b) difficult to work with;
at the moment I can't even get Python extension to compile on it, blech.

My only real gripe about buildbot is that it requires both
zope.interface and Twisted to run; unfortunately the prebuilt Windows
binaries for both packages are only available for older versions of
Python.  This means that unless I'm willing to compile packages for
Windows, I can only run python2.3 or python2.4.  Furthermore, even on
Linux, there are annoying problems: Twisted simply cannot be installed
with easy_install, and both buildbot and zope.interface have to be
manually downloaded before they can be installed, because easy_install
doesn't find the right packages automatically.  This renders
installation quite a chore.  Maybe after PyCon I'll take a look at
fixing some of these problems.
