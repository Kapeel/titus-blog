The PyCon Web Panel
# tags python,pycon07

So, I'm the organizer/moderator of the `PyCon Web Panel
<http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/nov-06/pycon-acceptance.html>`__.  This
will be a forum for maintainers of many of the main Python Web
frameworks -- Jim Fulton/Zope, Ben Bangert/Pylons, Adrian
Holovaty/Django, Robert Brewer/CherryPy, and Kevin Dangoor/TurboGears
-- to discuss their take on Python, the Web, and the future.  I've
also invited James Tauber, the maintainer of pyjamas, to join the
panel, since his talk on pyjamas got turned down and I've heard great
things about pyjamas.

I've also invited some people from the Quixote and twisted.web/Nevow
community to join us.  Aaron Swartz (web.py) wasn't available,
unfortunately.

Grig is also hosting a `Testing Tools Panel
<http://agiletesting.blogspot.com/2006/12/pycon-news.html>`__, and
I'll be representing twill on that.

Here are a couple of panel-relevant links from Guy Kawasaki: `The Art
of Panels
<http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/11/the_art_of_pane.html>`__, `How to
be a Great Moderator
<http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/03/how_to_be_a_gre.html>`__, and
`How to Kick Butt on a Panel
<http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/01/how_to_kick_but.html>`__.

I'll post some of the panel ideas I've had soon.
