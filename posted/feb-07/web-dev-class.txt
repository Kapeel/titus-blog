In the spirit of Greg's `Not on the Shelves
<http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/738.html>`__ post about books
he'd like to see, here's one class I'd like to see taught:

**Test-Driven Web Development**

This class will introduce students to test-driven software engineering
through the development of a database-backed Web site.  Student
development will be driven by requirements specified in acceptance
tests on a weekly basis, with periodic code reviews and demo
presentations.  The course will cover test-driven software
engineering, Web architecture, databases, JavaScript/AJAX, and good
software development practices.

Rough outline:

1. Hello, World: HTML, HTTP, and the Web
2. Structuring Web sites
3. Unit and functional tests
4. Storing and retrieving information from an SQL database
5. Data models and database architecture; object databases
6. Security thoughts: cookies, XSS, SQL injection attacks
7. Scalability and back-end architecture
8. Asynchronous page updates (AJAX) and JavaScript
9. Continuous integration and regression tests

Technologies: Python, JavaScript/AJAX, PostgreSQL, Linux

Prerequisites: Intro Programming

Textbook: *Dreaming in Code*
