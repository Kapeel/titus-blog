PyCon is coming, PyCon is coming!

`PyCon07 <http://us.pycon.org/TX2007>`__ (the biggest PyCon ever!) is
just around the corner, and I'm really looking forward to (pardon the
term) geeking out for a few days!  Python is my hobby, although it
leaks over into my work pretty regularly, and I expect to have a great
time forgetting about work and focusing on Python.

I don't think I'll be at too many talks, partly because I find that
simply downloading the software and hacking on it is a
higher-bandwidth way of absorbing information.  Heck, I mainly go to
talks to see what the author of some piece of code looks like, and
what with the testing tools panel, the python-dev panel, and the Web
panel, I expect to see or meet at least half the people I know ;).

Anyway, the point of conferences is to *meet* people.  So I look
forward to seeing everyone, and if you're looking for me, don't
hesitate to e-mail me or grab me or ... I particularly enjoyed some of
the dinners last year, where we would go out to eat with a bunch of
hackers and talk about something random.

Oh, and Phil Hassey, the creator of Galcon, is coming.  No word yet on
whether or not we'll have some massive let's-all-kill-each-other
Galcon fest, but it would be fun...
