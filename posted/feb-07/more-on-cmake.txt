More on cmake
# tags python,programming

I took a further look at `CMake <http://www.cmake.org/>`__ and
discovered that contrary to my `earlier understanding
<http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/jan-07/using-cmake.html>`__ it does in
fact generate XCode project files quite nicely.  Huzzah!

I'm still curious about the differences between `DART2
<http://www.na-mic.org/Wiki/index.php/Dart2Summary>`__ and buildbot.
I may have to put some time into installing DART2 to figure this out,
blech.  (For once, it's part of my job, at least. ;)
