Trying out 'cram'
# tags python,testing,pycon

I desperately need something to run and test things at the command
line, both for course documentation (think "doctest" but with shell
prompts) and for script testing (as part of scientific pipelines).  At
the 2011 testing-in-python BoF, Augie showed us `cram
<http://bitheap.org/cram/>`__, which is the mercurial project's
internal test code ripped out for the hoi polloi to use.

Step zero: wonder-twin-powers activate a new virtualenv! ::

 % virtualenv e
 % . e/bin/activate

Step one: install! ::

 % pip install cram

... that just works -- always a good sign!

OK, let's test the bejeezus out of 'ls'. ::

 % mkdir cramtest
 % cd cramtest

Next, I put ::

   $ ls

into a file.  Be careful -- you apparently need *exactly* two spaces before
the $ or it doesn't recognize it like a test.

Now, I run::

  % cram ls.t

and I get ::

  .
  # Ran 1 tests, 0 skipped, 0 failed.

Awesome!  A dot!

The only problem with this is that when I run 'ls' myself, I see::

  ls.t    ls.t~

Hmm.

As a test of the cram test software, let's modify the file 'ls.t' to contain a
clearly broken test, rather than an empty one::

  $ ls
  there is nothing here to see

and I get ::

  !

  @@ -1,2 +1,1 @@
     $ ls

OK, so I can make it break -- excellent!  Cram comes advertised with
the ability to fix its own tests by replacing broken output with
actual output; let's see what happens, shall we? ::

  % cram -i ls.t

OK, so, first, wtf is the whole reversed patch detected nonsense?  Sigh.
And second, where's the output from 'ls' going!?

Hmm, maybe cram is setting up a temp directory?  That would explain a lot,
and would also be a very sensible approach.  It's not mentioned explicitly
on the front page, but if you read into it a bit, it looks likely.  OK.

Let's modify 'ls.t' to create a file::

  $ touch testme
  $ ls

and run it... ::

  % cram ls.t

Ah-hah!  Now we're getting somewhere!  Fix the test by making 'ls.t' read
like so::

  $ touch testme
  $ ls
  testme

and run::

  % cram ls.t
  .
  # Ran 1 tests, 0 skipped, 0 failed.

Awesome!  Dot-victory ho!

Now let's do something a bit more interesting: check out and run my
PyCon 2011 talk code for ngram graphs.  Starting with this in 'khmer-ngram.t',
::

   $ git clone git://github.com/ctb/khmer-ngram.git
   $ cd khmer-ngram
   $ ls
   $ python run-doctests.py basic.txt

I run 'cram khmer-ngram.t' and get ::

After getting cram to fix the file (using -i), and re-running cram, it now
chokes at exactly one place; betcha you can guess where...::

Right.  How do you deal with output that does change unpredictably?
Easy!  Throw in a wildcard regexp like so ::

  Initialized empty Git repository in .* (re)

My whole khmer-ngram.t file now looks like this::

  $ git clone git://github.com/ctb/khmer-ngram.git
  Initialized empty Git repository in .* (re)
  $ cd khmer-ngram
  $ ls
  basic.html
  basic.txt
  data
  graphsize-book.py
  hash.py
  load-book.py
  run-doctests.py
  shred-book.py
  $ python run-doctests.py basic.txt
  ... running doctests on basic.txt
  *** SUCCESS ***

And I can run cram on it without a problem::

  .
  # Ran 1 tests, 0 skipped, 0 failed.

Great!

I love the regexp fix, too; none of this BS that doctest forces upon you.

So, the next question: how do multiple tests work?  If you look above,
you can see that it's running all the commands as one test.  Logically
you should be able to just separate out the block of text and make it
into multiple tests... let's try adding ::
 
  I'll add in another test:

    $ ls

to the khmer-ngram.t file; does that work?  It looks promising::

and it sees two tests... but, after fixing the expected output using
'cram -i', I only get one test::

  .
  # Ran 1 tests, 0 skipped, 0 failed.

So it seems like a little internal inconsistency in cram here.  Two tests
when something's failing, one test when both are running.  No big deal
in the end.

And... I have to admit, that's about all I need for testing/checking
course materials!  The cram test format is perfectly compatible with
ReStructuredText, so I can go in and write real documents in it, and
then test them.  Command line testing FTW?

And (I just checked) I can even put in Python commands and run doctest
on the same file that cram runs on.  Awesome.

Critique:

The requirement for two spaces exactly before the $ was not obvious to
me, nor was the implicit (and silent, even in verbose mode) use of a
temp directory.  I wiped out my test file a few times by answering
"yes" to patching, too.  What was up with the 'reversed patch' foo??
And of course it'd be nice if the number of dots reflected something
more granular than the number of files run.  But heck, it mostly just
works!  I didn't even look at the source code at all!

Verdict: a tentative 8/10 on the "Can titus use your testing tool?"
scale.  

I'll try using it in anger on a real project next time I need it, and
report back from there.

p.s. To try out my full cram test from above, grab the file from the
khmer-ngram repo at github; see:
