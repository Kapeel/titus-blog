How the Python stdlib changes (a public service message)
# tags python

In the interests of social anthropology, I feel compelled to point
Pythonistas at this fascinating discussion on the stdlib-sig on
`adding argparse to the Python stdlib <http://mail.python.org/pipermail/stdlib-sig/2009-September/thread.html>`__.  (Yeah, it's pretty much the only traffic that list got so far this month.)

Fascinating stuff.  If there's a secret cabal out there masterminding Python
development, they are clearly rather poorly organized ;)
