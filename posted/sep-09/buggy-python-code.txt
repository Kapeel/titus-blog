Buggy Python code?
# tags python,teaching

I'm looking for examples of frustratingly simple-yet-wrong Python code,
suitable for an undergrad class to debug.  I'd prefer things that don't rely on
tricky features of Python (like shared list references), but rather code
where subtly bad logic or program flow leads to bad behavior.

Comment below, or e-mail me; I'll post the ones I pick later.  thanks!
