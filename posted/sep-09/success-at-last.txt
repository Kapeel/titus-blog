Success, at last!
# tags python,smoking

For only the second time (out of many tries) I managed to smoke some
salmon and trout so that it was not overcooked and dry as a bone.
Conclusion? I think my smoker thermometer is about 50 deg F off of the
true "on grill" temperature, probably because it's about 3/4 of a foot
above the grill level.  So I just let the smoker sit at a lower
measured temperature and voila, tasty fish!

I *also* got a full Windows dev environment working, from scratch, for
Python.  I took advantage of the Snakebite MSDN account to grab
Windows XP and Visual Studio 2008, and then used Parallels to create
a VM and install everything.

A few comments:

Parallels (a Mac OS X app) makes Windows much more bearable.  On first
blush, they've really got a good setup for people who only occasionally
need to use Windows and generally hate every minute of it.  It's kind
of funny, really; even the Windows emulator is better on the Mac than
Windows is itself!

It took about 24 hrs of futzing to get everything installed and
updated.  I ran into several situations where I had to turn off the
Parallels disk sharing setup (which shares disks between the Mac host
and the Windows VM) in order to install packages.  This included the
Python 2.6.2 MSI installer, the Service Pack 2 upgrade, and (I think)
MySQL 5.1.

The purpose of this Windows futzing is to get a build client system
going for Windows XP; for that, I needed git and svn. I'm happy to
report that both git and svn have clients that are pretty much trivial
to install on Windows, and seem to Just Work: I used `msysgit
<http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/>`__ and the `Tigris.org download
<http://subversion.tigris.org/getting.html#windows>`__.

I ran into an infuriatingly opaque error compiling MySQLdb, and had to
figure it out myself; I didn't run across `this response
<http://forums.mysql.com/read.php?50,247493,247493>`__ until too late.
Briefly, if you have MySQL 5.1 installed, _winreg returns an error,
"the system cannot find the file specified"; you need to update
MySQLdb's site.cfg to look for MySQL 5.1 instead of 5.0.  This seems
like something that should be in MySQLdb...

Speaking of MySQLdb, it'd be nice to have binary packages of some
version or another for Python 2.6.  Binary builds for Windows of
packages with C extensions are really important for users.  Hopefully
I can help provide a better solution for this down the road.

Anyway, now I have a full blown dev environment: I can compile and
test pygr, I can compile and test CPython itself, and I'm happy.

I can even sit back and eat some yummy smoked fish.  How is that not a
win?

p.s. Now I have to repeat all of this for another Mac by which time I will
be an expert, I'm sure!  Bleah.
