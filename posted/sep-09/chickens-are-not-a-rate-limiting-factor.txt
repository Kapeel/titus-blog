Chickens are not a rate limiting factor
# tags biology,science

My wife and I were talking with my USDA collaborator about some possible
chicken research, and I asked about access to animals.  His response?
"Chickens are not a rate limiting factor."

Did you know that *1 million* chickens are slaughtered per hour, on
average, in the US?  Wow.
