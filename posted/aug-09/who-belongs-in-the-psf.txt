Who belongs in the PSF?
# tags python

So, it's nomination season for the `Python Software Foundation
<http://www.python.org/psf/>`__ again... and I have this niggling
feeling that I'm forgetting about several people that have
demonstrated significant commitment to the Python community, are good
'uns, and are otherwise people I would trust with some part of the
future of Python and the community.

PSF membership "worthiness" is hard to define, but (for me) depends
on more than just working in your own small patch of Python --
contributing broadly to GSoC/GHOP, for example, seems like a good
criterion.  Remember, people need a substantial *positive* vote by
the existing PSF, too, so they should be Known.  For some value
of Known.

Any thoughts?  `Drop me a line <mailto:ctb@msu.edu>`__.
