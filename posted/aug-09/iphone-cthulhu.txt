Why does my iPhone know how to spell Cthulhu?
# tags random,python

Very odd.  I mean, it's nice to have my prayers spell-checked and all,
but really, Apple?  Cthulhu?

Also, `jinja2 <http://jinja.pocoo.org/2/>`__ rocks.  I think I'll be teaching
it as a templating language this term...

And finally, people interested in using sqlite3 for shelve-like
storage in Python 2.x can take a look at `issue 52
<http://code.google.com/p/pygr/issues/detail?id=52>`__ in pygr's issue
tracker; I've taken the code from `bugs.python.org/issue3783
<http://bugs.python.org/issue3783>`__ and "backported" it to Python
2.x.  Since bsddb is no longer going to be part of the Python stdlib,
we're planning to switch to using sqlite3 for scalable data storage.
