In the spirit of Greg's `Not on the Shelves
<http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/738.html>`__ post about books
he'd like to see, here's one class I'd like to see taught:

**Test-Driven Web Development**

This class will introduce students to test-driven software engineering
through the development of a database-backed Web site.  Student
development will be driven by requirements specified in acceptance
tests on a weekly basis, with periodic code reviews and demo
presentations.  The course will cover test-driven software
engineering, Web architecture, databases, JavaScript/AJAX, and good
software development practices.

Rough outline:

1. Hello, World: HTML, HTTP, and the Web
2. Structuring Web sites
3. Unit and functional tests
4. Storing and retrieving information from an SQL database
5. Data models and database architecture; object databases
6. Security thoughts: cookies, XSS, SQL injection attacks
7. Scalability and back-end architecture
8. Asynchronous page updates (AJAX) and JavaScript
9. Continuous integration and regression tests

Technologies: Python, JavaScript/AJAX, PostgreSQL, Linux

Prerequisites: Intro Programming

Textbook: *Dreaming in Code*

   Let me try stopping salivating for a while and say those MSU students
   are a lucky bunch! I hope videos of the lectures will be on the Web,
   in true Open Source fashion :-)    Grig

   The syllabus seems far too practical.  Perhaps each step should be
   followed by a discussion of an esoteric alternative programming
   paradigm which was popular among a small group of academics in the 70s
   and has really never been surpassed in functionality and elegance?
   Now that's education!

   Michael, I think you're right.    "Database-Backed Web Programming in
   ALGOL"?    ;)    Seriously, although I do intend to provide plenty of
   practical information, for most of the items I do have plenty of more
   theoretical stuff to pass on.  I was thinking of trying to do a "1
   on/1 off" lecture style, with one day of pure practical stuff ("here's
   how HTTP works, guys!") and one day of theory (REST,  stateless
   interactions, HTTP as a limited API).  I'll probably have to flesh
   that out a bit more.    --titus

   Are you sure you're not part of the CIS department?    Back in at my
   university the CIS major was part of the school of business and they
   taught things like Visual Basic and Office Automation.     So of
   course the CS majors looked down on them for being clueless posers.
   On the other hand my CS department didn't know how to teach people how
   to program. (The only people who passed CS101 already knew how to
   code.)    Now we've got CS classes who are trying so hard to make CS
   approachable that they're even useing <a
