I've been invited to present at the `Extremely Large Databases (XLDB)
2012 conference
<http://www-conf.slac.stanford.edu/xldb2012/ProgramC.asp>`__ as a
practicing biologists who speaks with physicists, and I'm trying to
come up with something to say that will explain why physicists and
biologists don't often collaborate all that well.

1. Biology has only weakly predictive theory.

Physicists tend to rely on a lot of math, because over the last two
centuries it has turned out that relatively simple theoretical
assumptions can lead to a surprisingly accurate version of reality.  I
don't think it would be wrong to say that you can view much of physics
in the 1900s as a search for simple theoretical principles that
correspond with observational data.  The resulting theory has been an
amazing success in many ways, and no one would even think of trying to
interpret particle accelerator data without the aid of the Standard
Model.  In physics theory has turned out to be very *predictive*, in
that you can make specific predictions based on numerical calculations
and voila, upon looking you will find a match.

Biology, on the other hand, has no such strong theory.  Evolutionary
theory and ecological principles seem to describe some parts of
biological reality quite well, but it is difficult to imagine coming
out with very specific predictions from these theories and principles.
Since evolution *is* the basis of biology (cue famous `Dobzhansky
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodosius_Dobzhansky>`__, "Nothing in
makes sense except in the light of evolution"), and evolutionary
processes tend to construct stunningly functional solutions that
nonetheless look like Rube Goldberg contraptions, a lot of biological
detail looks like it has been created by an utterly insane genius.

There are lots of fun implications of this difference, including the
fact that mathematical models are hard to apply in biology, and that a
lot of biology inextricably involves what physicists (and the more
frustratingly close-minded biologists) call "stamp collecting" --
looking for new data that *doesn't* fit whatever mental or mathematical
or computational model you have.  (RNAi, anyone?)

2. Biology is increasingly integrative, rather than reductive.

I've known some awesomely intelligent physicists, and even published
with one or two.  (I'm happy to name drop if anyone is interested...?)
I've also known some really brilliant biologists.  They are generally
quite different types of people.  Physicists tend to seek simple
principles that they complexify as needed; biologists tend to seek
broadly inclusive stories that they simply as necessary.  If this is
an accurate generalization, I betcha it comes back to the Rube Goldberg
nature of biology: to extract general principles of evolution or
ecology or development, you need to look at immense range of very
confusing data; in physics, it seems to be possible to look at much
smaller sets of data.  Neither one is easy but I think the mental
shift necessary to encompass biological behavior is tough for many
physicists to make.

3. Career structure and lab management is just... different.

In physics, postdocs are considered larval faculty, and getting the
PhD and moving on is much more of a selective step than in biology.
In biology, getting a PhD can be easier -- often it involves a lot of
mindless repetition in the lab, followed by writing the results up in
collaboration with your advisor -- while the true selective transition
is the postdoc to faculty step, which relatively few people make.  (At
this point I should perhaps mention that I have one of those biology
PhDs, and yes, I did a lot of mindless repetition in the lab. I'm not
knocking it; it's necessary.  But it's different from what I would
have done in most of the physics labs I considered joining.)
Moreover, labs in biology tend to be run by one faculty member,
whereas at least at Caltech and Stony Brook and Ohio State, there was
a tendency to work in larger groups with multiple profs.

These differences may stem from the labor-intensive nature of much of
biology; the different funding approaches available and used in the
different fields; the cultures of medicine and ecology and evolution
vs the cultures of physics; etc.  I'm not sure. But in my not-so-limited
observation it's very different between biology and physics.

The most important *effect*, though, is that postdocs are generally
not very independent researchers in biology labs.  They are beholden
to their advisor, they aren't forced to do much "broad thinking", and
they're often treated as semi-slave labor.  And the recognition that
this *sucks* seems to have driven some of the options for "independent
postdocs" in biology such as the Broad Center and the Lewis-Siegler
independent postdocs/junior faculty positions.
