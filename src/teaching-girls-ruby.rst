Sarah Mei `posts <http://teachingkids.railsbridge.org/2009/08/15/teaching-ruby-to-high-school-girls.html>`_ about teaching Ruby to high school girls.  Good stuff.

While searching for some GHOP info from way back, I ran across `this post
<http://www.theopensourcereport.com/2008/02/12/ghop-winners-announced-but-where-are-the-girls/>`__
asking "where are the girls among the GHOP winners?"  (The statistics mentioned
in the post may have been posted since, although I haven't seen them.)
We asked the Python mentors to "rate" the students, and the hands-down
winner was someone who had worked closely with several different mentors and
performed very well.  Perhaps next time we should highlight everyone who did
well; there were several women in the group, too.

In general it's tough to raise the visibility of minority groups, though.  Do
we engage in affirmative action of some sort, and if so, how do we do so
without being unfair to others?  Or do we simply rank people in a
presumably gender- and color-blind way and see what happens?  I've talked
several times in various venues about trying to run a female-oriented GSoC
derivative, like GNOME's `Women's Summer Outreach Program
<http://gnomejournal.org/article/48/the-womens-summer-outreach-program>`__,
which would at least call attention to one minority in OSS... and if
GHOP ever happens again, we could work on getting younger women involved.

   Females are not a minority group. Females in fact comprise the
   majority of the population, at least in the United States.
