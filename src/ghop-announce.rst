I'm happy to announce that the Python Software Foundation is part of a
new Google Open Source program, the Highly Open Participation Contest.
This contest is an effort by Google to engage pre-college students in
open source programming: Google is offering prizes and awards for
completing a variety of tasks for several organizations.

You can read the official announcement of the PSF's involvement over
on the `Python Software Foundation blog
<http://pyfound.blogspot.com/>`__ (in a bit), or read about the overall
Google Highly Open Participation Contest `at the official announcement <http://code.google.com/opensource/ghop/2007-8>`__.  Python's GHOP project page is `here <http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-psf/>`__.

Ten organizations were invited to take part in this pilot: they are
Plone, SilverStripe, Moodle, the Apache Software Foundation, Python,
Joomla!, Mono, GNOME, Drupal, and MoinMoin.  (Note that Plone and
MoinMoin are both written in Python, so I think Python has a very good
representation!)

On a more sober note, it is clear to me that this is Google's latest
foray in their continuing efforts to gain control of the world and Do
Evil.  What could be more diabolical than paying *young students* to
work on *other people's projects*??  Google's perfidy knows no bounds.

Seriously, I'm very enthusiastic about this contest.  I have no idea
how it's going to turn out, but I think the Python GHOP team put
together a great `list of tasks
<http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-psf/issues/list>`__
and I'm looking forward to the results.

How can I help?
---------------

YOU can help in two ways: **suggest more tasks**, and **help mentor
participants**.  Instructions for doing both are available on the
project Wiki under `NewTaskGuidelines
<http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-psf/wiki/NewTaskGuidelines>`__
and `MentorPage
<http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-psf/wiki/MentorPage>`__.
(If you know eligible programmers, you might also point them at the
`Google Code project <http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-psf/>`__ -- there are some cherries ripe to be picked ;).

Who is to blame?
----------------

About two dozen people came up with the initial task ideas, including
some who had no idea to what they were contributing ;).  This includes
Brett Cannon, Collin Winter, Michal Kwiatkowski, Georg Brandl, Grig
Gheorghiu, Greg Wilson, Terry Peppers, Shannon Behrens, Michael
Carter, Phil Hassey, and Michael Mol.  The blog comments on my blog
for the two posts `Projects for people new to Python?
<http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/nov-07/new-to-python-projects.html>`__
and `Hidden Gems in stdlib
<http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/nov-07/hidden-gems-in-stdlib.html>`__
were very helpful as well!

A group of five people actually wrote up most of the tasks and checked
them over for obvious inanities: Will Guaraldi, Andre Roberge, Doug
Hellmann, Georg Brandl, and me. This same group is largely responsible
for the Google Code project pages.

Andre Roberge, Doug Helmann, Georg Brandl, Grig Gheorghiu, Steve
Holden and I are the current "project mentors".  Won't you
`join us <http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-psf/>`__?

Leslie Hawthorn at Google did an amazing job of coordinating everyone.
She deserves a great big heap o' thanks from the entire Python
community!

::

   The task list contains many tasks for adding documentation and/or unit
   tests to pre-existing code.  While helpful to the Python community,
   these seem like pretty boring exercises for high school students. I
   can't think of better tasks right now so I won't belabor the point..
   but the coding tasks for creating APIs for reddit and myspace do seem
   fun!
