According to the `silly language quiz <http://www.bbspot.com/News/2006/08/language_quiz.php>`__, I'm `Python <http://www.bbspot.com/Images/News_Features/2006/08/language/python.jpg>`__!

"You are Python. You are slower than others, but easier to understand. You are
a minimalist, who doesn't like clutter."

I don't like to think of myself as slow, but there you are -- that's what I
must be.  (Perhaps I have a lot of C extensions compiled in? ;P

   No, that would make you slow to load but extremely fast in execution

   Consider yourself lucky ... I am apparently Cobol. I am very business-
   oriented.  I make conversations longer than they should be, and people
   easily grow bored by you.    Thats a lot to take on board
