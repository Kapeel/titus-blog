I gave a talk yesterday at the 2013 `BEACON
<http://beacon-center.org>`__ Congress titled "How to build an enduring
online research presence using social networking and open science."
The talk slides are `here <http://www.slideshare.net/c.titus.brown/2013-beaconcongresssocialmedia-25245386>`__.

This talk was a combined survey of sites and personal perspective on
how social media has helped shape the last 5 years of my professional
life (as a tenure-track assistant professor) and why I think it's a
valuable approach for scientists to think about taking.

A few notes from discussions during and after the talk:

* Quite a few people are looking for *instructions* and I only
  partially conveyed how nascent this area still is.  Active online
  scientists are still unsure of basic questions about things like
  tweeting during conferences, blogging research prior to publications,
  and doing open review; we might have solid, mature thoughts on these
  issues in a few years.  Until then, enjoy the Wild West, y'all!

* A few people signed up for Twitter, and some were motivated to think
  about starting blogs -- one particular woman told me she was
  interested in starting a blog not about her science, but about
  gender issues *in* science that she and a local support group had
  experienced.

  Neato.

* A very prominent professor said that they'd enjoyed my talk very much
  and were thinking about how to begin blogging.  !!

* Someone who was privy to my reappointment conversation (why does
  this guy not have lots of papers? what is going wrong? what's this
  blogging stuff?) engaged me in a long conversation that, I think,
  boiled down to me needing to make this clear: I am not planning to
  go up for promotion based on my klout score.

  That is, I think that some people are worried that I really *will*
  try to get tenure by arguing that my blogging and tweeting is super
  awesome and deserving of tenure.

  Nuh-uh.  What I wanted to convey from my talk was that social media,
  online interaction, and open science *feed into* paper citations,
  grants, and reputation -- the traditional measurements used for
  scientific promotion.  And, inasmuch as I have any strategy, that is
  my strategy.

All in all, some interesting comments and positive responses.
