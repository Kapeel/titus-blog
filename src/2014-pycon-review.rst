PyCon 2014: Community, community, community. Also, childcare.

There were lots of problems with PyCon this year.  For example, the
free, hi-speed wifi made you log in *each day*.  And it was in
Montreal, so one of my foreign students couldn't come because he
didn't get a visa in time.  The company booths were not centrally
located.  And, worst of all, the PyCon mugs aren't dishwasher safe.

So, as you can imagine, I was pretty disappointed.

Haha, no, just kidding.  PyCon 2014 was *wonderful*!  For the first
time, I brought quite a few people from my lab; my wife & two children
(6 and 3 yro) also came, because it was driving distance from Michigan,
and so we just packed everyone into a minivan and drive 700 miles.

Community
---------

My labbies -- none of whom had ever been to PyCon before -- said that
they really enjoyed the conference.  In large part that was not just
because of the talks, but because of all the subcommunity stuff that
went on -- I heard that the various women-centric and LGBTQ meetups
were great.  The efforts to raise diversity and enforce the code of
conduct at PyCon (especially in light of last years' happenings) paid
off this year: I heard of no major CoC violations, and while
mansplaining was apparently alive and well in some Q&A sessions, the
overall atmosphere was really friendly and welcoming.

As Michael Crusoe pointed out to me, PyCon has clearly decided that
they will focus on community more than technology -- which is probably
the only truly sustainable path anyway.  Highlighting this, there were
plenty of talks on Python, and also plenty of talks on other things,
including building community and raising awareness.

A particular highlight for me in this regard was Naomi Ceder's talk on
being a member of the `Python community both before and after she
transitioned
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=4R6FXtZl154>`__.
What an amazing way to raise awareness, and what an excellent talk.

On Childcare
------------

This was also the first year that PyCon had childcare.  It was great!
We brought our six and three year old girls, and they spent Friday,
Saturday and Sunday of the conference in a meeting room in one of the
conference hotels.  Presumably it will be similarly located next year
(PyCon 2015 will be in Montreal also), and I can't recommend it highly
enough.  Our girls loved it and were very happy to go back each day.
They had activities, movies, and swimming - good fun.

I would suggest changing a few things next year -- first, it would be
great if parents knew where childcare was going to be.  As it was we
stayed in the other hotel (Hyatt?), and had to walk from one hotel to
the other (the Hilton, I think) before going to the conference. This
extended our morning quite a bit; next year, if we bring the kids,
it'd be nice to just walk them downstairs in the morning.  Second, it
might be nice to have the option of extending childcare a day or two;
my wife had to take the children while I taught Software Carpentry on
the Monday after the conference.  We did make use of an in-room
babysitter from the daycare to go out one evening, and that was great!
She even taught our older child some French into the bargain.

From a larger perspective, it was super fun to have the kids at the
conference without having to have either my wife or myself take care
of 'em all the time.  My wife (who is also technical) got to attend
talks, as did I, and I got to introduce the kids to a few people (and
make Jesse homesick for *his* kids) -- maybe next year we can do some
more young-kid-focused gatherings?

My talk
-------

I gave a talk again this year -- it was on instrumenting data-intensive
pipelines for cloud computing.  You can see `all the things
<http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2014-pycon.html>`__.  It was reasonably
well received; the crowd was smaller than `my 2013 talk <http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2013-pycon-awesome-big-data-algorithms-talk.html>`__ `(video) <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKBwGlYb13w>`__, because I'd
avoided sexy keywords, but I got good questions and several people
told me it had made them think differently about things, which is a nice
outcome.

My talk was sandwiched between two other great talks, by `Julia Evans 
(talking on Pandas) <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEalbu8UGeo>`__ and `David Beazley (talking about what happens when
you lock him in a small enclosed space with a Windows computer that
has Python installed along with several TB of C code) <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ4Sn-Y7AP8>`__.  Julia's talk
was hilariously high energy -- she gets way too excited about bike
routes ;) -- and David's was, as usual, the highlight of the conference
for me.  You should go watch both of 'em.

Next year, I'm thinking about doing a talk on sequencing your own
genome and interpreting the results with Python.  I think that means I
need to sequence my own genome first.  You know, for science.  Anyone
got a spare $1000 lying around?
