At PyCon 2012, I took a tutorial on the `IPython Notebook
<http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/interactive/htmlnotebook.html>`__,
which I'd already been using for a month or two (ever since Wes
McKinney (the author of `pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/>`__)
introduced me to it).  The tutorial blew me away -- these guys have
done a great job with the notebook so far, and it looks like it's
going to keep on improving at a really fast rate.

At Greg Wilson's urging, I'd already committed to doing a screencast
of ipynb.  I was even more enthusiastic about the idea after sitting
through the tutorial.  So, without further ado -- here it is!

Note -- the Amazon EC2 AMI used for this is available publicly as
ami-74d00c1d.  The IPython Notebook password is 'gadzooks'.

You can download the intro notebook I adapted for the screencast here:

Enjoy!

p.s. I mention `StarCluster <http://web.mit.edu/star/cluster/>`__ in passing -- it's a great scientist-oriented command line tool for working with EC2.

   Thanks for the demo! I'd like to recycle it but I am getting an
   "Invalid JSON data" error when I try to import your notebook.

   Matt, you're probably using an old version of ipython notebook; my
   ipynb isn't compatible with 0.12.  Sorry :)
