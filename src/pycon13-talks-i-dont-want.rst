There's been a lot of discussion about PyCon talks that we *do* want
to see.  Here's a brief list of those I *don't* want to see, for those
ofyou considering a submission -- in no particular order.

1. 1001 Mocking Frameworks - a comparison and overview

2. Long Live Twill

3. Zope vs. Django - why Zope was right all along

4. Why We Need More Men in Python - a Diversity discussion

5. Centralized Version Control - it's the future

6. Guido van Rossum on Python 4k - it's the future

7. Running Python under Windows on my Superboard II

8. Lists - way more useful than you ever thought

9. What the Python Community Can Learn from Java

10. Solving Easy Problems - my very own customized approaches

Any other ideas?  Add 'em or send me links :)
