On Thursday, May 15th, I finished my post-doc position at Caltech.

On Friday, May 16th, I officially started as an Assistant Professor
split between Computer Science & Engineering and Microbiology &
Molecular Genetics at Michigan State University.

On Friday evening and Saturday, we hung out down at the Caltech Marine
Lab and partied.

As I type, I'm on a plane flying from California to Michigan, where
my cat and I will spend our first night in our new house.

My wife and daughter will join me on Wednesday.

All of our stuff is en route and will arrive later in the week.

On Monday, I will start "directing" my new lab: I already have several
local summer students, as well as a part-time research assistant.  Two
graduate students and a postdoctoral fellow will be starting with me
later in the summer.

Hooray!
