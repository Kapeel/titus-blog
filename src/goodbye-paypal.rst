I'm going to stop using my Paypal account regularly as soon as I
finish transferring some money around.  They're too screwed up to be
reliable, and their customer service is either incompetent or
dishonest.

Luckily, many places are now accepting credit cards or Google Checkout,
with which I've had no problems.
