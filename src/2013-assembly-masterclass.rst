Question: What do Nick Loman, Jared Simpson, Lex Nederbragt, and I all have in
common?

Answer: We all spend *way* too much time thinking about assembly.

----

Question: What does Jonathan Eisen's lab do?

Answer: Sequence lots of really weird things that they'd like to assemble.

An assembly masterclass
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Motivated by conversations during Holly Bik's excellent `SMBE Satellite
Meeting on Eukaryotes <http://eukaryoticebullience.blogspot.com/2013/05/wrap-up-of-smbeeuks-meeting-and-qiime.html>`__, it is clear that there is lots of
interesting stuff going on at Davis in general.  But they also have lots of
weird and challenging assembly problems.

So, I invited us all to run a workshop at Davis, hosted by Holly and
funded by the NIH and NSF, to explore topics at the intersection of
"sequencing weird stuff" and "assembling it."  The goal, in brief, is
to explore assembly approaches, algorithms, software, and sequencing
data at a "masterclass" level, which basically means "we're all
confused but we are really experienced at being confused about this
particular topic, so we'd like to help you out."

More specifically, we hope for one outcome of this workshop to be a
review paper talking about challenges of sequencing and assembling
diverse critters.  I think we'll also develop some ideas for new
diagnostic tools and approaches while we're there.

**Attending**: The workshop is mostly booked up by Eisen lab members,
but we do have a few spots open for other people; drop me or Holly a
note.  (You'd have to supply your own travel and lodging; this is not
a particularly *well*-funded workshop. :)

As to "Why Davis?", well, it's where the Eisen Lab is, and also if you
are doing something in December, California seems like a better choice
than England (Nick), Oslo (Lex), Toronto (Jared), or Michigan (me).
