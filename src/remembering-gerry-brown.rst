My father, Gerry Brown, passed away yesterday.  He had been convalescent
for some time, so this was not entirely unexpected, but it sure is
final when it happens.

Gerry was a fairly well known physicist.  His `Wikipedia page
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_E._Brown>`__ gives a pretty good
summary of his professional life, and I am sure there will be an obit
somewhere.  I'll post any I see in the comments below.

I've set up an `information page <http://ivory.idyll.org/gerry/>`__ to
let interested people know what's going on.

Gerry lived a long and, I think, mostly fulfilling life.  As I
mentioned in `my post on mentoring
<http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/on-mentoring.html>`__, he trained almost
100 PhD students during his career (apparently he served as the
advisor for 72 PhD exams!); he was also a member of the National
Academy, edited several journals, and played a big part in physics --
especially nuclear physics and astrophysics -- for many, many years.
One of the most surprising things to realize, as he fell more ill & I
started to delve into his scientific affairs, at the same time as I
myself entered the professoriate, was just how much he had done; he
was already quite well known (e.g. a member of the National Academy)
in the 60s, and his files were fascinating reading.  As I tried to
help my mother with mail, the daily deluge of papers, journals,
invitations, personal mails, etc was both awe inspiring and just plain
stunning.  He was still going full blast right up until serious
illness stopped him.

In many ways, the Gerry I knew *was* his work, and I almost completely
missed the chance to talk with him about politics or non-scientific
ideas.  I came along late in his life, as part of his second family --
I have siblings who are quite a bit older than me -- and I never saw
the politically passionate person that he had been in his youth.  Only
once I got old enough to speak with him as an adult -- and got wise
enough to want to talk to my father ;) -- did I start to understand
how much the `McCarthy era
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCarthyism>`__ had cost him (hint: his
first family was *not* American).  Just before he fell ill, he made
reference to the powerful disillusioning impact that his experience
during the `Peekskill Riots
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peekskill_Riots>`__ (I think) had on his
political interests.  For this alone I would have liked to know him
better.  His stories on Cold War visits to East Germany, which came
with attempts by the Stasi to recruit him, were fascinating; he also
had a few colorful anecdotes about joining the Navy towards the end of
WWII, and I bet there was quite a bit I didn't hear, and now never
will.

He went through several dark periods in his life, many due to financial
hardships.  As a result, he placed great priority on supporting and
enabling his children with financial help at the right moment.  I, for
one, did not acknowledge this enough.

My father shaped both my personal life and my professional life quite
a bit, of course.  I interacted quite a bit with senior faculty from a
very early age, which might help explain some of my attitudes towards
the Game of Tenure.  I got my entree into research through some of
these contacts, too, and my father's reputation continues to serve me
in my own career: nepotism, of a sort.  My entree into biology came as
a result of interactions with Chris Adami and Steve Koonin, as well as
`a conversation with Hans Bethe
<http://advogato.org/person/titus/diary/65.html>`__ -- all people I
knew through my father.  The intuitive and phenomenological approach
he took bears a strong resemblance to how I prefer to do research.
And, increasingly, it looks like several of his grandchildren
inherited some of his mathematical skills, which should lead to
interesting times ahead.

The two pieces about his life that I most wish to see made public are
these: first, the chapter by Sabine Lee entitled `"What is the
Universe? Gerry Brown -- His Life and Work"
<http://books.google.com/books?id=Ikrt42W9IOgC&pg=PA1&lpg=PA1&dq=fly+with+eagles+gerry+brown&source=bl&ots=n5i6CYBCqF&sig=xAs-3WyBLVXBSukdtG4-yOpq5F0&hl=en&sa=X&ei=NDCqUZ2nEerBygHW6YCgCA&ved=0CD0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=fly%20with%20eagles%20gerry%20brown&f=false>`__;
and second, `"Three Weeks with Hans Bethe"
<http://books.google.com/books?id=HaL-NNHBmM0C&pg=PA45&lpg=PA45&dq=three+weeks+with+brown+bethe&source=bl&ots=QmBcbLO2PY&sig=D3WqJDyZg4dAj7qQYQm5KRmd6kc&hl=en&sa=X&ei=GTGqUfLxJOOFyQGQ2YG4CA&ved=0CFAQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=three%20weeks%20with%20brown%20bethe&f=false>`__
by Chris Adami, which is a journal of three weeks that Chris spent
with Gerry and Hans Bethe in 1992.  (`Hans passed away in
2005. <http://advogato.org/person/titus/diary/65.html>`__) There is
also a small autobiographical sketch entitled "Fly with Eagles" that I
can't find online; it's Gerry's account of his interactions with
Gregory Breit, Rudolf Peierls, and Hans Bethe, three of the great
physicists of the 20th century.  The first two pieces are available in
the book, `From Nuclei to Stars: Festschrift in Honor of Gerald
E. Brown
<http://www.amazon.com/Nuclei-Stars-Festschrift-Honor-Gerald/dp/9814329088>`__.

In many ways, Gerry was a giant -- in the lives of his children; in the
lives of his students, collaborators, and colleagues; and in the subfields
of physics where he worked.  He will be missed by many.

Gerry is survived by his wife, four natural children, his ex-wife, two
step-children, and seven grandchildren, as well as several hundred
academic "offspring".
