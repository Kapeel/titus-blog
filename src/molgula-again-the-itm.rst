I just flew back from Montreal, where I gave a talk at the
`International Tunicate Meeting
<http://apps.mni.mcgill.ca/tunicate/home.html>`__ on the `Molgula
project
<http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/aug-10/about-those-molgula.html>`__.
This is a project wherein we are doing quantitative mRNA sequencing on
two species of ascidians, or sea squirts -- specifically, on
*M. oculata* (tailed), *M. occulta* (tailless) -- and their
hybrids.  We just got some initial results from the sequencing, and so we
took the opportunity to go up to Montreal and present on it.

In addition to my talk, I presented the same content `in poster form
<http://ged.msu.edu/downloads/2011-itm-tunicate-poster.pdf>`__, and
Elijah Lowe presented some initial results on `notochord genes
<http://ged.msu.edu/downloads/2011-itm-tunicate-poster-elijah.pdf>`__,
which are subtly wrong (my fault, long story) but still quite
interesting.

Since the Molgulids are representatives of not-very-well studied branch
of the ascidians, Stolidobranchs, we are also making some of our
sequence available.  Specifically, you can go to our "data" page,
`here <http://public.ged.msu.edu.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/molgula/>`__, and grab about 40,000 transcripts assembled from our *M. oculata*
mRNA sequencing efforts.  Enjoy!
