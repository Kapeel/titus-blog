A recent visiting speaker, `Dr. Sinead Collins
<http://www.smallbutmighty.bio.ed.ac.uk>`__ from Edinburgh, mentioned
in passing during her talk that she was particularly interested in
mentoring and empowering women in science.  I am `also interested in
this
<http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/pycon-2013-and-codes-of-conduct.html>`__,
but as a male in a position of power I'm wary of preaching to women on
the topic of sexism and have had a hard time figuring out what to do.
Since Sinead was in town for a few days, I took the opportunity to ask
her for *her* top 3 suggestions for what *I* could do.  We spent about
half an hour talking about it, and I have to say I really enjoyed it!

These are my summary of her suggestions, transcribed (and probably
misunderstood) by me.  Polite comments, extensions, and disagreements
welcome; others will be plonked.

1) Encourage everyone to finish their thoughts without interruption, and
   encourage interrupters to notice that they are interrupting (and stop).

   Free-flowing conversations in lab meetings and other scientific
   interactions can include people interrupting each other (generally
   with enthusiasm, admittedly ;).  This may be offputting or
   demoralizing to junior people, or people who haven't developed a
   robust sense of self-confidence yet.  One way to help junior people
   develop self-confidence is to make sure that they get to complete
   their thoughts before someone else speaks.  For example, if someone
   interrupts, as the lab head, stop them and ask the person they
   interrupted if they had completed their thought.  This encourages
   the interrupted to be vocal, and also alerts the interrupter that
   they are being rude.

   (While this isn't specific to women or URM, some young women are
   more polite and/or more hesitant about challenging interruptions.)

2) Show up.

   As a male authority figure, participate!  Show up to meetings about
   sexism and gender inequity; join committees and panels if there is
   room; be aware that the more senior a woman gets, the more likely
   she is to be swamped by the need of gender-balanced panels to have
   senior women on them, and try to help out with other committees as
   much as you can.

3) Mentor young women to deal with the world as it is, in the hope
   that they may change the world that will be.

   Double standards and sexism exist today, so plan accordingly. For
   example, if you have tattoos, consider covering them up for a first
   meeting, so that the tattoos will not distract either negatively
   *or* positively.  In some ways this is pandering to a double
   standard, but there's no doubt the double standard exists and could
   affect people's thinking; pick your battles.

   More generally, armor your female students to face the world they
   will need to live in.  Discuss issues like imposter syndrome, the
   need to speak clearly and forcefully and not back down in the face
   of occasionally aggressive questioning, career decisions around
   marriage and children, etc.

From my perspective, these are good specific things for me to do.

Any other thoughts or ideas?
