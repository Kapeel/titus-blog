I spent some time over the last week adding fairly simple motif
searching to `Cartwheel <http://cartwheel.caltech.edu/>`__, my
bioinformatics site for biologists doing cis-regulatory analysis of
genomic sequence.  The new features include the ability to define and
search with IUPAC and position-weight matrix (PWM) motifs, as well as
visualization of motif search results on actual sequence.

I made `a 5 minute screencast demo <http://idyll.dreamhosters.com/transfer/motif-screencast-try3.mp4>`__; take a look!
