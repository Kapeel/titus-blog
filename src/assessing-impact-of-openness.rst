How can I assess the impact of our "openness"?

I've been asked -- in several different contexts now -- whether not
the openness of my lab has had any specific impact.  I blog about
active research; we develop our code in the open; we post papers to
arXiv; we emphasize remixability; I'm pushing open data in consortia;
and we are trying to train scientists in the underlying techniques and
technology necessary to be open.  (I have a `link-heavy summary of
this available in my draft blog posts
<http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/drafts/w4s-personal.html>`__, actually; never
posted it tho.)

I'm giving a talk in a few weeks at my local institution where having
specific examples of this would be helpful.  I also want to write up
something for my tenure paperwork, and having an example or three of
how others have benefited from something I've made open would be
really great.

So, umm, could people send me any stories they might have?  Either
posted in comments or `e-mailed to me <mailto:titus@idyll.org>`__?  (I
won't make them public if you don't want me to, but I'd like to talk
about them anecdotally.)

Right now, all I could really say is that (a) there are a surprising
number of people using `khmer <http://github.com/ged-lab/khmer>`__, (b)
an awful lot of people have found the `NGS course materials
<http://ged.msu.edu/angus/tutorials-2013/>`__ useful, and (c) ... well,
that's really about it.

I like to think of my lack of coherence here as a feature -- I think
there's quite a bit to be gained by simply doing what is
straightforward and easy, and not proselytizing it too much as being
super-ground-breaking or part of a coherent long-term vision (which
would be hard for me to pull off anyway as I have no idea where I'm
going) -- but it does make it hard to "sell" the impact of it to
doubters.  What should I say when asked?

Anyone?  Anyone?  Buhler?
