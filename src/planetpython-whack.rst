Heh, I'm back to me.

I've been posting under Andrew Kuchling's name on `planetpython.org
<http://www.planetpython.org/>`__ for a while now, and today it appeared that
all was fixed!  Sadly, it turns out that my new posts are the result of me
posting via my `new blog <http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/>`__, which is then
syndicated to my `old blog <http://www.advogato.org/person/titus/>`__, which in
turn is syndicated to planetpython (a route I just set up today).  This would
be entirely fine if it weren't for the fact that commenting doesn't work on
advogato.org, and there's no way to get to my new blog (with its commenting
functionality) from my old blog.  Sigh.

Oh, and I'm betting that this post shows up twice: once under Andrew Kuchling, and one under me!

   I'm working on the diary/blog code in Advogato now. What would need to
   be added to fix your immediate problem? Would something like a
   permalink to each of your new blog posts embedded somewhere in the
   syndicated recentlog post on Advogato help?

   Hi steve!  I'm not complaining at all about advogato , just FYI ;).
   The new features are fantastic!    The usual thing for syndicated
   blogs is to have something clickable that goes to the syndicated blog.
   Perhaps just the date header, or 'go to original blog', or...?
