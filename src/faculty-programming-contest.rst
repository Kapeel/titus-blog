Does anyone know if there are any faculty programming contests out there?

It'd be fun, and I can't imagine that the competition would be as tough as
the student programming contests probably are ;).

   Um... faculty members... programming? You lost me.

   No there isn't.    Because they suck. If they knew anything about
   programming they would not be sticking around in a  job like that.

   You might want to check out topcoder:  <a
   href="http://www.topcoder.com/">http://www.topcoder.com/</a>    They
   do the google software challenge, and python is one of the supported
   languages. If you want to set up a special event they can do that as
   well (though it might not be free).

   ToothyByte, I know several faculty that would be happy to teach you
   the error of your inference ;).    Thanks, Doug.    --titus

   Titus,    unfortunately, for every single one that you find I can show
   you five that know nothing of sorts you'll find them teaching subjects
   such as 'advanced web programming' or 'bioinformatics'

   I'm confused.  Advanced Web Programming and Bioinformatics aren't fit
   subjects for computer science? Or they are, and faculty can't teach
   them (because "they suck")?    Ahh well.  It's fun to watch the trolls
   come out to play...

   nothing personal Titus, I'm just someone who has been deeply
   disappointed by the level and quality of bioinformatics instruction
   ... one of these days spend an hour reading the source code of some
   packages in Bioconductor, you'll then see madness and insanity ...

   Ahh.  If that's the case, then I think we would agree on most things
   ;)
