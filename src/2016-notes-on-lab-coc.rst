I'm writing this up for the `rOpenSci call on Codes of Conduct <>`__ that I'm
participating in tomorrow.

----

My lab has `a lab Code of Conduct <http://ivory.idyll.org/lab/coc.html>`__.

We adapted it from
`https://github.com/confcodeofconduct/confcodeofconduct.com
<https://github.com/confcodeofconduct/confcodeofconduct.com>`__.

Adoption was not motivated by any one particular incident, although
there have been a few incidents of problematic behavior over the
years.  It was more motivated by our adoption of a Code of Conduct for
the `khmer software project
<https://github.com/dib-lab/khmer/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.rst>`__,
which is one of our major projects, and also by the `Software
Carpentry Code of Conduct
<https://software-carpentry.org/conduct/>`__.  (Note that Michael
Crusoe was the originator of the CoC on the khmer project and has been
both a strong proponent and an excellent resource for creating
friendly workspaces.)  We also attended an excellent `Ada Initiative
<https://adainitiative.org/>`__ workshop at PyCon in 2015 that
convinced me of a CoC utility for the lab.

Another motivation to adopt a lab code of conduct came from our training
efforts, where it is clear that impostor syndrome rules and it takes quite
a bit of overt friendliness for people to ask questions.

I will note that there are a few unfriendly and/or obnoxious people in
bioinformatics, and that at least two of these individuals have targeted
students or collaborators in my lab.  Not much to be done about that,
although Twitter's "block" functionality works *extremely* well for me,
or at least so I assume ;).

A lab code differs from a workshop or community code of conduct in a
few ways.  The primary difference I see is at the intersection of
authority and longevity - unlike an online community, there is a
de facto authority (the head of the lab), who within some limits
can make decisions for the lab; this is like a workshop where someone
can be asked to leave by the workshop organizer.  But unlike
a workshop, labs exist for a long time, and so there are longer term
relationships to consider.

My goal in adopting a code was to make it clear that everyone could
speak comfortably, without fear of being targeted.  I've had
experiences in very macho labs, and also experiences in very
noncritical labs, and I wanted to maintain both the ability to give
and take criticism within the lab *and* the ability to have a friendly
and productive lab atmosphere.  I believe this is important for
the development brainstorming and creativity, as well as simply making
the lab a nice(r) place to be.

There have definitely been benefits in recruiting: having a code (and
following it!) means that people know you are aware of many issues that
all too many faculty seem *unaware* of...

A key aspect of our code is that it places expectations on the boss as
well (that's me).  Part of this is having someone to complain to me
about; this has only been used once, and it was super important
because I simply hadn't realized how much of an ass I was being.

It also enables labbies to take the initiative when something comes
up, which has happened a few times.  This doesn't need to involve me;
lab members have felt free to speak up and remind others that what
they are saying is inappropriate or hurtful, in part because they know
that we have set expectations and I will back them up.  This seems to
work well, the few times it has been used.  (Although I've never had to
back anyone up.)

Fundamentally a code of conduct defines a social contract and sets expectations
for everyone in their basic set of interactions. I've found it to be a
net positive.
