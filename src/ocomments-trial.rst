Ok, I've just enabled my ``ocomments`` plugin for pyblosxom_ on this blog.

``ocomments`` is a hacked version of the ``comments`` plugin that keeps
track of users and lets me approve users and posts individually.  Hopefully
it will let me keep the blog spam free while letting regular posters
comment freely.

Eventually I'll add some features so that regular posters can also approve
posts, but that's down the road a bit.

   I use pyblosxom for my blog.  Initially I was very happy with it, but
   later I became somewhat disillusioned.  There's too much effort
   required to set up things like spam-proof comments, tags, or through-
   the-web posting (which is why my blog doesn't have any of those ;).

   I'll help Grig with the heckling.

   Marius,    it took a bit to set up, but I'm fairly happy with
   everything. I had to hack on the tags, and of course I'm using a
   different comments plugin, and I'm using reST and darcs to post via
   emacs and my laptop file system, but the point is that I **could** do
   all of  those things ;)

   Shouldn't you be doing those thesis revisions?  Shouldn't I be doing
   experiments?
