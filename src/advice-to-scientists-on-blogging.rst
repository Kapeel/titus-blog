My `advice to graduate students: blog!
<http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/advice-to-graduate-students.html>`__ post
garnered some interesting comments here and there.  Most of the
responses were positive, but then again, most anyone who reads blogs
probably doesn't need to be convinced that blogging is useful.  In
particular, note that some
of the comments at the bottom of that post offer personal and insightful
perspectives on the value of social media outreach.

So! What next?

ObDigression: I am pro grad school
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I do want to make it clear that I am very pro-grad-school.  Academia
has been an awesome career, despite its manifold negatives; I am very
happy to be here, feel privileged to work with people as smart as my
colleagues, and do not have any particular interest in leaving.  Grad
school is one of the few places where you can really learn to do
research, and the apprenticeship model that we use in grad school has
the potential to work quite well.

I, personally, regret very little about my graduate school career.
But I'm one of the "lucky few" who both wanted & got a tenure track
faculty position.  (You can debate whether or not people should *want*
to go into the professoriate, but you cannot debate that many appear
to want to but will simply not have the option.  I did, in no small
part, because I was lucky in my parents, my mentors, and my research.)

This career path means that I'm not that reliable a source when it
comes to evaluating grad school -- as I said in my `advice to grad
students
<http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/advice-to-graduate-students.html>`__,
when a tenured Harvard professor talks about how moving to Google is
so wonderful, you should wonder about its applicability to your own
life.  Same with me.

This is why I really want to highlight Neem Serra's blog post, `I Quit
Grad School <http://neemserra.com/i-quit-grad-school/>`__.

Neem was an undergrad in my lab for a bit, and she decided to pursue
research in no small part because of that experience.  She went on to
other labs (Lenski and Ofria) and racked up virtually every undergrad
award you can think of, and then applied to grad school pretty much
everywhere on the West Coast.  She got into virtually every *grad
school* she applied to (except UCSD - what was up with that, folks?).
She then went to grad school, funded by an NSF predoctoral fellowship.

But, somewhere in there, she decided grad school wasn't for her.
There are many things that went into that decision, and maybe someday
she'll blog about them.

In the meantime, Neem has given what I think is one of the best
*defenses* of grad school I've ever read.  So `go read it

Back to some advice: "how do I start blogging??"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One thing I didn't address in my "go blog, you fool!" post is how to
actually begin blogging.  For me, it's as simple as "have strong
opinion; write about it." I took a certain amount of flak for that
opinion at home, because while I conveniently have lots of strong
opinions and obviously have no problem telling the world about them,
there are many people that are more hesitant than me about such
things.  I also do not require or even strongly request that my own
grad students blog, which you can view as hypocritical, as bad
advising (failing to prepare my own students!?), or as good advising
(it *should* be optional).

Moreover, there were a few comments on `my "go blog" post
<http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/advice-to-graduate-students.html>`__ that
raised some pretty interesting questions.  To try to summarize,

1. Should I worry about people stealing my ideas?

2. If I blog about my research, are there potential conflicts with
   journal submissions?

3. Should I worry about posting something stupid?

4. Related: should I blog pseudonymously?

The overarching question here is, how do I start blogging, and what about?

The short answer is, I don't know the answers. But here are my
opinions and advice :).

The most conservative way to start blogging is to pseudonymously write
short reviews of papers relevant to your research -- think an
annotated bibliography, of sorts.  Then post them to twitter, or find
a friendly colleague in your research area to post them (I am happy to
do this for bioinformatics and evo devo papers).  This serves several
useful purposes: it gets you used to writing blogs; it gives you feedback;
it helps filter the literature a bit, by saying "I found this paper
useful (or not) for the following specific reasons"; it may drag
the authors of the paper online to rebut or refute or complement your
comments; and you may even get useful tips about what papers to read
next.

(I wish I did more of this.  I hope to have some interesting news on
`an actual Selected Papers network
<http://www.frontiersin.org/Computational_Neuroscience/10.3389/fncom.2012.00001/abstract>`__
soon, BTW.)

If you start pseudonymously, you can get a feel for whether or not
you're saying something useful, and you can start to generate Web
traffic.  You can even refer to your blog on your CV and in interviews
without "outing" yourself, although at some point you may be exposed
to the wider world.  I would suggest planning to make a decision about
if and when to go public after your first one or two dozen blog posts;
by then you should know if it's useful or not, and also whether or
not it's sustainable.

As a graduate student, I'm a bit skeptical that full-on blogging about
your research is a good idea without the permission of your advisor.
Some labs (mine! Jonathan Eisen's!) are likely to be more supportive
than others, to put it mildly.

One strategy I'm suggesting to my grad students and postdocs is to
blog `through me
<http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/jgr-assembling-the-amazon.html>`__, as
that way they get some review and also some exposure right up front.

My views on secret stealing and stupidity are `well documented here
<http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/grants-posted.html>`__, and so far I can
tell you that I have no serious qualms about posting my own research
online.  There is definitely a risk/reward tradeoff, but I trend
towards openness -- which is `working out really well for me
<http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/openness-and-online-reputation-recognized-in-grant-reviews.html>`__.
I also `practice a somewhat conservative version of open science
<http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/blog-practicing-open-science.html>`__, in the sense that I am happy posting *preprints* but tend not to blog about my stuff until it's solid.

So the short, only mildly snarky answers are:

1. Should I worry about people stealing my ideas? No, ideas are a dime a dozen.
   Worry about being relevant instead.  But if you are concerned about this,
   I would recommend starting by blogging about other peoples' ideas first.

2. Are there conflicts with journal submissions? Generally, no, `not
   even with full-on submitted papers <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_journals_by_preprint_policy>`__.

3. Should I worry about posting something stupid? It depends on your
   self confidence, I guess.  I regard posting stupid things as the
   fastest way to progress karmically; the `fail often so you can
   succeed sooner <http://startupquote.com/post/567414487>`__
   mentality. One good trick is to phrase things you're uncertain
   about as questions that frame your own stupidity: "I didn't
   understand why they claimed that this result showed that their
   assembler was good.  What am I missing?"  *Everyone* is happy to
   help correct your ignorance :)

4. Should you blog pseudonymously? It's probably a good way to dip
   your toes in the water, but at some point you'll face
   exposure. Plus, you won't get all the reputational benefits of
   having a blog from it.  So my rec is to only do it for a
   short-to-medium period of time, and then decide to either quit
   or stop worrying about being outed.

I hope this is helpful advice.  I'd love to hear more questions or comments.

Something I would really like to offer to do, but cannot commit to
doing, is to review blog posts in my area of research (bioinformatics,
assembly, metagenomics, etc.)  On that note, it might be cool to put
together a closed forum (something like the `Python core mentorship
program <http://pythonmentors.com/>`__) for students and pro-blogging
professors to communicate about blog posts.  If this is interesting to
anyone, let me know!
