The pygr project is gearing up to do some code reviews, and we're not
aware of too many (any?) mature (or even adolescent) tools that
interact well with git.  A Google search finds `Gerrit
<http://android.git.kernel.org/?p=tools/gerrit.git;a=summary>`__ and
`a blog post about Code Review
<http://community.livejournal.com/evan_tech/252161.html>`__ --
anything else we should know about?

thanks,
--titus

p.s. If you `e-mail me <t@idyll.org>`__ I will summarize here; or you
can comment, but I might lose your comment in all the spam :(

   Several people have e-mailed me that Code Review contains support for
   git -- excellent!  I'll have to take a look.    --titus
