We have an opening for a project on which I'm collaborating:

   Full-time 12 month appointment academic position for a genomics
   scientist.  The incumbent will spend 50% time as the Associate
   Director of the Comparative Genomics Laboratory, with duties in
   directing daily activities, long-range planning and seeking
   extramural funding, and 50% time to conduct research.  Qualified
   candidates should have an earned Ph.D, training in Bioinformatics
   or Quantitative Biology and strong interests in evolution of early
   vertebrate genomes and functional genomics.  Postdoctoral
   experience preferred.  Initial appointment will be for three years
   as a fixed-term assistant professor in the Department of Fisheries
   and Wildlife at Michigan State University, with possible
   renewal. Email a single PDF or word file containing cover letter,
   CV and statement of research interests to liweim<at>msu.edu before 30
   Sept. 2008.

Note that this is a non-tenure-track assistant professorship, so it's
fixed term and soft money.  We don't have positions like this in my
departments (comp sci & molecular biology) but you could think of this as
a very senior, very well paid, and very independent postdoc position.
