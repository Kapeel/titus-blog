Recently the question came up: suppose you wanted to give enthusiastic
people some guidance on how to help work on Python.  What suggestions
do you have?  Surely there's a Web page on this!

Well, no: a few quick Google searches led me to discover that "contributing
to Python" was answered neither succinctly nor well in any of the resulting
pages.

So I thought, heck!  Let's create a wiki page!

Check it over and add in your own ideas.

   This activity alone will help Python incredibly, Titus, so thank you!
   It's also an object lesson in creative anarchy: don't wait to be told
   what needs doing, just do what obviously needs doing!    Thanks again.
