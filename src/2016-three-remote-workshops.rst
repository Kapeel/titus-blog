We're running three half-day workshops for your remote viewing pleasure!
All three will be live-streamed via YouTube (well, Hangouts on Air).

Today 2/17, at 9:15am PT, Tiffany Timbers (Simon Fraser U.) is going to be going through regular
expressions in Python - see `the workshop description <https://dib-training.readthedocs.org/en/pub/2016-02-17-regular-expressions-python.html>`__.

On Friday, 2/19, same time, same place, Ariel Rokem (U. Washington) will be
`introducing scipy.optimize <https://dib-training.readthedocs.org/en/pub/2016-02-19-scipy-lr.html>`__.

And, in just under two weeks, on Monday 2/29, Adelaide Rhodes (Oregon State University) will be `showing us how to build static Web sites with Sphinx <https://dib-training.readthedocs.org/en/pub/2016-02-29-sph-webh-bitb-lr.html>`__.

All three workshops will be live-streamed as well as available for
archival viewing.  We'll post the YouTube links on the workshop pages
above, but you can always tweet us at `@ctitusbrown
<http://twitter.com/ctitusbrown>`__ or `@jessicamizzi
<http://twitter.com/jessicamizzi>`__ if you want the hook-up.  (We'll
also do live-stream support as possible.)
