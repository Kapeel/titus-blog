Dear lazyweb, what's the situation with Java and C++ OODBs?  I seem to
recall hearing vaguely good things about some Java OODBs from real
people (i.e. not marketing flacks) but I haven't kept that information
anywhere.  (I did find `this amusing article
<http://blogs.tedneward.com/2006/06/26/The+Vietnam+Of+Computer+Science.aspx>`__
on how O/R mapping is the Vietnam of Computer Science, though!)

Does anyone have any positive personal experience with OODBs in, well,
any language other than Python?  (For Python, I recommended ZODB and Durus.)

tnx!
