I am pleased to announce that we will be running a two-week summer
workshop on analyzing high-throughput sequencing data!  This workshop
will run from June 26-July 8th, 2017, and it is an continuation of the
two-week NGS workshop run at Michigan State University since 2010.
(You can read about `the 2015 workshop here

With our move to UC Davis, this year we will be able to take 3-4x as
many applicants as in previous years!
