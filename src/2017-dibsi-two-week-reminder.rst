Our two-week summer workshop (`announcement
<http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2017-dibsi-two-week.html>`__, `direct
link <http://ivory.idyll.org/dibsi/ANGUS.html>`__) is shaping up quite
well, but the application deadline is today! So if you're interested,
you should apply sometime before the end of the day.  (We'll leave
applications open as long as it's March 17th somewhere in the world.)

Some updates and expansions on the original announcement --

* we'll be training attendees in high-performance computing, in the
  service of doing bioinformatics analyses.  To that end, we've
  `received a large grant from NSF XSEDE
  <http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2017-dibsi-xsede-request.html>`__,
  and we'll be using JetStream for our analyses.

* we have limited financial support that will be awarded *after* acceptances
  are issued in a week.

Here's the original announcement below:

ANGUS: Analyzing High Throughput Sequencing Data
------------------------------------------------

June 26-July 8, 2017

University of California, Davis

* Zero-entry - no experience required or expected!
* Hands-on training in using the UNIX command line to analyze your sequencing data.
* Friendly, helpful instructors and TAs!
* Summer sequencing camp - meet and talk science with great people!
* Now in its eighth year!

The workshop fee will be $500 for the two weeks, and on-campus room
and board is available for $500/week.  Applications will close March
17th.  International and industry applicants are more than welcome!
