This is one of a bunch of posts on science and the Web.  `Start here
<../w4s-overview.html>`__ for an overview.

A while back I discovered a central theme to my blog posts -- `better
science through superior software
<http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/big-data-biology-2.html>`__.  I've now
realized this is one part of a `larger interest
<../w4s-overview.html>`__: to change the culture and practice of
science to be more effective by being more open and online.

Witness:

1. Posting grants publicly -- http://jabberwocky.weecology.org/2012/08/10/a-list-of-publicly-available-grant-proposals-in-the-biological-sciences/ and http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/grants-posted.html

2. Posting papers to arXiv -- http://pathogenomics.bham.ac.uk/blog/2012/10/all-the-cool-kids-are-on-arxiv-and-haldanes-sieve-why-you-should-be-too/ and http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/science-f-yeah.html

7. Open and reproducible research that can serve as a foundation, but only
when it's ready http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/replication-i.html and http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/blog-practicing-open-science.html
