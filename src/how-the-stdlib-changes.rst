In the interests of social anthropology, I feel compelled to point
Pythonistas at this fascinating discussion on the stdlib-sig on
`adding argparse to the Python stdlib <http://mail.python.org/pipermail/stdlib-sig/2009-September/thread.html>`__.  (Yeah, it's pretty much the only traffic that list got so far this month.)

Fascinating stuff.  If there's a secret cabal out there masterminding Python
development, they are clearly rather poorly organized ;)

   In a dark corner of bar in the outskirts of Paris, classical music is
   playing from the period of the French Revolution. The buxom waitress
   delivers a couple stout buxom beers. The python secret cabal sip their
   beers slowly, waiting until the waitress is out of earshot.    Guido:
   "Are you sure you weren't followed?"    Brett: "Absolutely. I wore the
   hunchback disguise again. It's brilliant, no one could recognize me."
   Guido: (folding his fingers together) "Excellent."    Brett: "Alright,
   let's plunk argparse into the standard library."    Guido: "Why?"
   Brett: "Those Perl folks have had a tough time of it lately,
   especially since we released Python 3 already. If we put argparse into
   the standard library, we'll have three ways of parsing command-line
   arguments. I'm hoping that Simon will finish of optfunc, and we can
   put that in there later too and bring the count up to four."    Guido:
   (chuckling) "They'll accuse of TIMTOWTDI! That'll be good for a laugh.
   Let's do it, it'll give them something to talk about on reddit. At
   least we won't have to read endless arguments about US health care
   reform for one day ..."    Brett: (firing up emacs) "Alright, let's
   get to work then. Time to make it look like there's a discussion
   taking place on stdlib-sig."    Guido: "This is my favorite part.
   Nobody suspects our secret cabal since we just forge a bunch of phony
   discussions. The appearance of a choatic open source development
   community is the perfect disguise for our cold, calculating changes to
   the  Python standard library."    Brett: "Your Warsaw e-mail
   impersonations are spot on."    Guido: "You do a good Foord
   impersonation."    Brett: "I love how you do the all of the Cannon
   impersonations though, that's the best - you sound just like me!"
   (both let out a deep belly laugh, they raise their glasses to a toast,
   then all is quiet except the furious sound of typing)
