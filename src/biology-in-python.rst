To get people talking, I've created a "biology-in-python" mailing list.  You
can subscribe here: `http://lists.idyll.org/listinfo/biology-in-python
<http://lists.idyll.org/listinfo/biology-in-python>`__, and you can post to it
at bip@lists.idyll.org once you're a member.

This list is a tool/package/library-agnostic list, for people who use Python to
work in the biological sciences.  Join us!
