What's the equivalent of prime number calculations, for biologists?

`Randy Olson <http://www.randalolson.com/>`__, who is watching
amusedly from the side lines as I struggle once again to `teach
programming to graduate students in biology
<http://ged.msu.edu/angus/beacon-2012/index.html>`__, asked a really
good question (it's rare, yes, but it should be acknowledged for
encouragement) --

  Had a student from your class ask me today if it's typical for
  programming assignments to become more relevant once you get to a
  certain level of programming. I told him that yeah, that's typical,
  since you need a certain level of data structures and control flow
  to start making really useful programs. Usually most of the problems
  you solve when you're first learning programming are abstract/not
  really practical.

  Then that got me thinking: are there relevant, non-abstract problems
  (for biologists) that you can solve with minimal programming skills?
  Hmm..

  I'm curious, though, if there's a biology equivalent to "calculate
  the primes" etc. that are traditional CS newbie problems.

So... is/are there? Discuss amongst yourselves!

thanks!
