Just submitted this on Thursday: 

  Next generation sequencers are beginning to impact agricultural
  biology.  Over the next few years, next generation sequencing will
  produce incredibly large datasets that will address structural
  (e.g., SNPs, CNVs, indels, methylation, translocations) and
  functional (e.g., RNA expression, transcription factor binding
  sites) variation in genomes that will provide detailed insights that
  could explain phenotypic variation.  Despite this immense power,
  next generation sequencing in agricultural animals will not be used
  effectively due to the lack of easy-to-use computational tools to
  support data analysis, and the unique needs of agricultural animal
  genomes.  We propose to build an easy-to-use Web interface that
  incorporates several existing mapping and post-mapping analysis
  programs for next generation sequencing data that will greatly
  empower agricultural researchers.  We will also provide solutions to
  issues such as unfinished and unannotated assemblies, private data
  sets, private annotations, etc.  Our tools will give individual
  investigators or small groups with no computational support the
  power to utilize and interpret next generation sequencing data.
 
Any guess as to the funding agency?  `Yep...

   Err, why?  It's about software engineering.
