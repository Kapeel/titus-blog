I just received an e-mail from someone in the funding world who thinks a
lot about software, and they were interested in any thoughts I might have
on the term "software hardening", and its practice.  To quote,

  This is about making research software more robust, more easily usable and
  possibly scalable.

This language has been seen in the wild - e.g. see `Extended
Development, Hardening and Dissemination of Technologies in Biomedical
Computing, Informatics and Big Data Science (R01)
<http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-14-156.html>`__ -- although
it's not defined specifically.  Taking language from the announcement,
I think they mean some subset of this:

   First, contemporary software must be easy to modify and extend, and
   must be fully documented. Users who experience problems with
   software should be able to correct the problem with minimal effort
   and a mechanism must exist for incorporating these corrections into
   the software. As the needs of a community of users change, the
   software that supports their research efforts must be adaptable as
   well. The ability of software to be repaired and to evolve is
   particularly important because the scientific discovery process is
   open-ended and ever-changing.

I have my own thoughts about hardening that I will share in a few days,
but I thought I'd see what other people thought first!  Pointers to other
such language would also be welcome...

p.s. Wikipedia `sez
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardening_(computing)>`__: "hardening
is usually the process of securing a system by reducing its surface
of vulnerability."
