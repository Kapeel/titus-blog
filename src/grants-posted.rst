I've just posted my 2nd try at the NSF CAREER award `(solicitation)
<http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2011/nsf11690/nsf11690.htm>`__ to the
`lab Web
site, where it joins my recent NSF BIGDATA proposal, my Moore
Foundation proposal, last year's NSF CAREER award, and my one big
funded grant, my USDA proposal from 2009.  The two latest grants,
combined, lay out an algorithmic framework for solving the short-read
Big Sequencing Data problem.

I have to admit I don't have a clear goal in posting them.  It feels
risky, because what if?  What if someone *takes my brilliant ideas and
steals them?!* Or, uh, I'm not really sure what the downsides are.  My
only actual concern is that people will read them and laugh at me
because they suck so badly.  I'm consoled by thinking that no one will
ever read such long and dense documents, so the odds are that random
Google queries are the only way that people will ever read them.
Whew.

(I suppose Anthropologists might find them interesting -- writing these
things is what many professors spend much of their time doing.)

On the plus side, the contents are now available to people who want to
know what I do, and my students and postdocs have an example (for
better or for worse) of what grants look like.  Plus there's a bunch
of dandy PhD projects in there!

Why don't more people post grants?  I'm really not sure, except that it
seems like part of the culture of secrecy that pervades science (to its
frequent detriment).  I'm sure one concern really *is* theft of ideas;
perhaps another concern is the lack of an obvious upside.  What else?

With respect to theft of ideas, I offer a few counterpoints.

First, I have lots of ideas; that's part of why I went into science,
which purports to give me the opportunity to explore whatever ideas I
do have.  So, go ahead and "steal" them -- then I can go off and work
on some of my other ideas!

Second, what about duplication of effort!?  Honestly, the odds are
poor that anyone will simply take my ideas verbatim -- it's much more
likely that they will mix and match.  Combine that with the general
duplication of effort in science and I'm just not that worried about
it.

Third, even if my ideas are swiped, it's not likely to affect the
funding of the grant they were taken from; there's some vague worry
there about how maybe people would see duplication in two grants and
have to choose between them, but I don't actually see any way for that
to work, since I'm only posting the grants once they've been
submitted.

Fourth, my grants are statistically unlikely to be funded.  The
funding rate for most NSF panels is in the 5-10% range, which means
that only 1 in 10 to 1 in 20 grants will actually be funded.  Since I
have to write them anyway, I'd like to try to maximize their utility.
Who knows, perhaps some foreign government will see a use for
weaponizing metagenome assembly techniques and I can get DOD-style
funding!! 
Or a funding fairy will magically appear to throw bales of cash
at me.  Or, much more likely, someone will want to collaborate.

Fifth, I think theft of ideas is overblown.  Someone actually cares
enough to think my ideas are worth stealing? **I'd be lucky to be that
relevant.** I can't even get people to download and use our awesomely
functioning open source software, which comes with documentation,
tutorials, and papers, and actually solves real problems.  What hope
do I have that my *grants* -- which are rather focused -- would be
more relevant than actual functioning software?

Sixth, even if my grants *are* stolen, it's unlikely to affect my
career that much.  My career has only been improved by all the
nonofficial things I do (open source, blogging, etc.) and I've been
sort of unimpressed by the effect of toeing any notional lines of
behavior (grants! papers!) that all seem to have long latency and be
severely biased towards already successful career scientists.

So I don't see any big downsides, and there are a lot of potential
upsides (see: funding fairies).  In the end, it's an experiment, like
so much else of what I do: what are the downsides to being
aggressively open about such things?  I'll find out!  Stay tuned...
