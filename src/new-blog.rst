I've just moved my blog over to `Pelican
<http://pelican.notmyidea.org/en/2.8/index.html>`__, a static blog
generator that takes in reStructuredText and spits out, well, this!
I'm now using `Disqus <disqus.com>`__ for commenting, too.

The main motivations for the move (apart from slightly better theming) were
to escape dynamic-blog-land in favor of static-blog-land, while enabling
a better commenting setup.  Pelican+disqus looked like a great solution;
we'll see how it goes!

One note -- rather than hack and slash my way through disqus's commenting
system upload fail, I just attached all of the comments as "legacy
comments" on old blog entries.  Yeah, it sucks, sorry.
