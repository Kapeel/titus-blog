**This is early draft text that Anita and I put together from a bunch
of brainstorming done at the `Imagining Tomorrow's University
<http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/Conferences/ImagineU/>`__ workshop.
Comments welcome!**

Communities are the fabric of open research, and serve as the basis
for development and sharing of best practices, building effective open
source tools, and engaging with researchers newly interested in
practicing open research.  Effective communities often emerge from
bottom up interactions, and can serve as a support network for
individual open researchers.  A few points:

* These communities can consist of virtual clusters of likeminded
  individuals; they can include scholars, librarians, developers and
  tech staff or open research advocates at all levels of experience
  and with different backgrounds; the communities themselves can be
  short-lived and focused on a specific issue, tool, or approach, or
  they can have more long-term goals and aspirations.
* A key defining feature of these groups is that the principles of
  open science permeate their practice, meaning they are inherently
  inclusive, and aim to open up the process of scholarly exploration
  to the widest possible audience.
* We recommend that all stakeholders take steps to create an ecosystem
  that encourages these communities to develop. This means supporting
  common standards, funding "connective tissue" between different
  efforts, and sharing practices, tools, and people between
  communities

After collecting a series of narratives on effective and intentional
approaches to creating, growing, and nurturing such communities, we
recommended the following actions for different stakeholders to
support the formation of adaptive and organic, bottom-up, distributed
and open research communities:

Institutions:

* Provide physical space and/or admin support for community
  interactions.
  
* Recognize the need for explicit training in principles and practice
  of open research.
  
* Explore what "design by a community" looks like in areas where itâ€™s
  not traditional, e.g. (mechanical) engineering, to change views of
  what constitutes excellence in a discipline.
  
* Reward incremental steps: provide incentives for aspects of open
  science (e.g. only share code, not data, or vv) then make it really
  easy to continue down a "sharing trajectory".

Funders:

* Recognize how "disciplinary shackles" can hinder adoption of Open
  Science practices (e.g. development of common software/workflows and
  other community resources may not be respected as part of
  disciplinary work).
  
* Award interdisciplinary and team efforts next to or instead of
  individual competition. Inclusivity is a defining feature of Open
  Science, as well as extensibility, reproducibility - goal is not
  solely to further individual rewards but to facilitate involvement
  of others: not lock-in economics, explore other reward
  methodologies.
  
* Reward incremental steps: provide incentives for aspects of open
  science (e.g. only share code, not data, or vv) then make it really
  easy to continue down a "sharing trajectory"

Platforms and publishers:

* Integrate training materials into platforms.
  
* Support development of platform specialists inside institutions.
  
* Start "pop-up" open science communities around e.g. datatype manipulation.
  
* Build support for openness into tools.
  
* Create communities around specific tools and practices; build norms
  and codes of conduct into these platforms endemically
  
* Lower barriers of entry to sharing practices, tools can support the
  "automatic" creation of communities (cf social media tools, platforms
  help define communities (e.g. "My Facebook friends", "My Jupyter
  Friends")
  
Community organizers:

* Build openness into governance
  
* Recognize the value of simple narratives for roping people into
  community participation.
  
* Funding culture changers: hiring people who are tasked with changing
  e.g. data dissemination processes/practices
  
* Praise incremental steps towards openness by community members.
  
* Establish a code of conduct and community interaction expectations.
