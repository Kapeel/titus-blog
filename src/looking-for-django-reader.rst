Looking for a Django Reader

I've just finished the last rough draft of a short e-book, *An Intro to Testing
Web apps with twill and Selenium*.  The book has four sections:

 1. Introduction
 2. twill intro
 3. Selenium intro
 4. Testing an app with twill and Selenium

The "app" being tested in #4 is just the very simple poll app from the Django
tutorial, and I'd like to get some comments from a Django expert (which I am
not!)  I'm particularly interested in thoughts on how to distribute the app for
readers, but I also want a gut check from someone who knows this stuff cold.
Any takers?  `Let me know <mailto:titus@idyll.org>`__.

(The e-book will be available sometime in the next few months from O'Reilly,
for people who are generally interested in these topics.  It should cost about
$10.)

cheers,

   What format will the ebook be available in?  This is something I'd be
   interested in buying since I have Django app I need to learn to test
   better.

   My guess it will be a PDF. The fact that it is under $10 and from
   O'Reilly implies that it will be a 'Short Cut'.    -adam
