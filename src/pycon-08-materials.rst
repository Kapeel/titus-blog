Here are some of the materials from my PyCon activities:

`The tutorial source code
<http://ivory.idyll.org/permanent/pycon-08-tutorial-source.tar.gz>`__
(which is really just a cut down version of `my PyCon '07 talk's
source code <http://darcs.idyll.org/~t/projects/pycon-07-talk-source-latest.tar.gz>`__; see
`the README <http://darcs.idyll.org/~t/projects/pycon-07-talk-source/README.html>`__ and `my blog post from back then <http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/mar-07/pycon-talk-source>`__).

`The tutorial slides (PPT) <http://ivory.idyll.org/permanent/pycon-2008-testing.ppt>`__

`My OLPC/testing talk (PPT) <http://ivory.idyll.org/permanent/olpc-testing-pycon08.ppt>`__.

(Sorry about the PPT format; printing to PDF increases the size 10x.)

As a bonus, `here <http://ivory.idyll.org/permanent/pycon-db-test-08.tar.gz>`__ is a pair of example fixtures for resetting PostgreSQL databases.  (See ``utils.py`` in the two subdirectories.)

I will post a demo/screencast and the source code from my OLPC/testing talk
as soon as I clean it up a bit.

   Keynote exports them to PDFs that are "only" 2x or 3x larger:    <a

   I used OpenOffice to export the presentation to a PDF file half the
   size of the original PowerPoint file. Let me know if you want me to
   send it to you.

   What about that mentioned Youtube video from Google where they
   supposedly say how incredibly many Selenium tests they have?
