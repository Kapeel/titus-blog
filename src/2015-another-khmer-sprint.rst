Michael Crusoe and I are throwing a sprint!

Somewhat in the vein of `last year's mini-Hackathon
<http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2014-khmer-hackathon.html>`__, Michael
and I and other members of the lab are going to focus in on reviewing
contributions and closing issues on `the khmer project
<http://github.com/ged-lab/khmer>`__ for a 5 day period.

`Subscribe to the github issue here, to track.
<https://github.com/ged-lab/khmer/issues/751>`__

We'll be working ~9-5pm Eastern, all five days, weekend excepted. We
are planning to focus on `khmer <http://github.com/ged-lab/khmer>`__
`screed <https://github.com/ged-lab/screed/>`__, `khmer-protocols
<http://github.com/ged-lab/khmer-protocols>`__, and `khmer-recipes
<https://github.com/ged-lab/khmer-recipes>`__; other lab projects
(like paper pipelines or workshop materials) are fair game, too.

We don't have any particular physical location in mind, but you're
welcome to join us at Michigan State University to hang out in person.
We also plan to be fully online-enabled within the 9-5pm EDT period,
and can set up video conferences and screen sharing with people who
want some help.

Here are reasons you might want to join us:

* you're interested in seeing the "github flow" model in action, for
  scientific software (including automated tests, continuous
  integration, code review, and a pre-merge checklist!);

* you have a particular bug or problem you want to fix in any of our
  software;

* you work for or with the lab.

Again, `subscribe here <https://github.com/ged-lab/khmer/issues/751>`__ to
be kept in the loop as our plans progress.

cheers,
