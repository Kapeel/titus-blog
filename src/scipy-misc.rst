While I'm thinking about `SciPy '07 <http://www.scipy.org/SciPy2007/>`__,
here are a few other notes:

 - Chris Lasher and I are thinking about doing a Software Carpentry
   sprint of some kind.  `Interested? <mailto:titus@caltech.edu>`__

 - I'd be up for doing a half-day tutorial on "Testing for Scientists" or
   "Idiomatic Python".  `Interested? <mailto:titus@caltech.edu>`__

   As long as you are sprinting on SWC, you might want to check out this
   timely thread:    <a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.python.t
   utor/42698">http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.python.tutor/42698</a>
   where a couple of authors of popular Python books are pointing out
   some errors of fact in SWC.
