I was out at `Michigan State University <http//www.msu.edu/>`_
discussing a faculty appointment last week, and we continued to talk
about using Python for an introductory Computer Science class.

Two questions came up and I'm hoping to get an answer to both via
the LazyWeb:

 * Who else is doing it?  What other universities or colleges have
   switched to using Python as the very *first* language to be learned?

   I think we're especially interested in people's actual experiences,
   but we'd also like to just find out who is using Python.

 * Books.  What good books are available for intro CS in Python?

   Looking on the `IntroductoryBooks page <http://wiki.python.org/moin/IntroductoryBooks>`__, I see many books listed:

      - `Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=1887902996>`__

      - `How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0971677506>`__

      - `Learn to Program Using Python: A Tutorial for Hobbyists, Self-Starters, and All Who Want to Learn the Art of Computer Programming <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0201709384>`__

      - `Python How to Program <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0130923613>`__

      - `Python Programming for the Absolute Beginner <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=1592000738>`__

      - `Computer Programming is Fun! <http://www.handysoftware.com/cpif/>`__

      - `Python First: Introduction to Computing with Python <http://studypack.com/comp/mod/resource/view.php?id=2923>`__

Does anyone have personal experience with using these to teach?  Please
either `e-mail me <mailto:titus@caltech.edu>`_ or post a comment -- thanks!

   Not really a book as such, but you should be aware of what Greg Wilson
   has done with Software Carpentry (http://swc.scipy.org/).

   Hi,    I'm a lecturer at the Australian National University in
   Canberra. We have recently (2005) started a new course which uses
   Python as a first programming language in the framework of media
   computation (manipulating pictures, sounds, Web sites etc). The course
   Web site is:    <a href="http://cs.anu.edu.au/student/comp2720/">http:
   //cs.anu.edu.au/student/comp2720/</a>    The course is based on the
   excellent book:    Introduction to Computing and Programming with
   Python: A Multimedia Approach by Mark Guzdial, Prentice-Hall, 2005,
   ISBN 0-13-117655-2.    More on this approach can be found at:    <a

   The University of Southampton uses it as the first language in it's
   engineering courses (mechanical, aero, ship, ...) nowadays afaik.  You
   may be interested in asking this question on the edu-sig mailing list
   (http://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig) as I think the course
   organiser lingers around there.

   Not sure if you are looking for an academic text but  I see Dive Into
   Python recommended alot. I think it is a very thorough text. It has an
   ink and paper version as well as the academically sexy online version:
   <a href="http://www.diveintopython.org/">http://www.diveintopython.org
   /</a>    As an employee of MSU I know that Python has slithered it's
   way into some different places around campus. You may also want to try
   some of the mailing lists that MSU has to offer to see what others
   might think.

   find links to schools using a 'Python First' digital pack. A link to a
   paper that advocates the benefits of Python as CS1 language is posted

   Senac's university centre in Sao Paulo (Brazil) currently teaches
   Python as the first programming language, for Comp. Sci. and
   Information Systems courses.

   Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, has just
   switched their first year Computer Programming courses from C to
   Python.

   I am a professor in Computer Science at Columbus State University,
   Columbus, GA. We are teaching a CPSC 6106 Fundamentals of Computer
   Programming for returning graduate students without background in
   Computer Science. It a remedy course covering topics of CS1 and CS2.
   We have decided to use the approach of Python first, Java second
   language. We have adopted and we are using the Study Packs available
   at <a href="http://studypack.com">http://studypack.com</a>. The
   textbooks and slides are available online, there are quizzes (multiple
   attempts), and lab work with each topic. Below I am copying some
   excerpts from student feedback about the Study Packs and Python as a
   first language.    "With this class being 1 of three online classes
   that I have take so far in my Master studies, this online course has
   been the best so far.  The CMS that StudyPack is using is great and
   makes Vista look like a 1,000 lb gorilla.  The material is just right
   for a intro, online class, for returning students that may not be
   initially comfortable with online learning."  "Hi Dr. Zanev.  You
   asked for feedback on the course thus far, specifically with respect
   to using Python as a first language.   I had never used Python before,
   but I've discovered that I really like it.  It is fully featured,
   modern, sophisticated, yet elegantly simple.  I can easily create
   short quick programs that would just be too much bother in a
   traditional compiled language such as Java or C/C++. I know a bit of
   Java, and I believe the two are complementary, especially in the
   manner in which Study Pack has prepared the Python course (using
   parenthesis around conditional expressions, using semicolons at the
   end of each statement, etc., make the transition to Java easier)."
   " I was very pleased with the Python course and hope to see similar
   course formats in the future.  Python seemed to me to be very
   intuitive; however, my programming experience is, for the most part,
   limited to some introductory programming courses 20+ years ago, so I
   don't have much with which to compare.  I really appreciated that the
   course was very structured and that student workload was predictable.
   I found that the quantity of material was a challenge at times and
   that your estimate of 18 hours per week for time required was accurate
   for me."    "I like Python as an introductory language. Much easier
   than jumping straight into Java. Just looking at the first Java
   assignment has already convinced me of that. It may not be harder, per
   se, but it looks harder and would be very intimidating.  I think
   Python is a lot friendlier, and the IDLE interpreter color coding
   makes it easier for novices to see what's going on."

   We've used Python in the first year of our degree programmes at the
   University of Leeds in the UK for three years now.  Indeed, it was,
   for a couple of years, the first language encountered by our students
   on single-honours programmes.    Unfortunately, for reasons
   administrative and political, we've not been able to continue like
   this, but I've managed to keep Python as part of our first-year
   single-honours teaching, in the form of an open-ended, project-based
   module.  We've also introduced this year an elective module in
   programming aimed at students studying something other than computing,
   and this, too, will use Python.    Our students generally love Python,
   and increasing numbers of them are using it in their final-year
   project work.
