I fixed a problem in the tagging plugin (which was really a bug in the way
I was entering tags, sigh) so now I can provide RSS feeds based on my tags.
This is important because I want to continue being syndicated on
planetpython/planet.python, but I don't want to spam Python people with
unrelated Python posts.

For the record, the "root" RSS feed is http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/?flav=rss
and the Python-specific tag feed is http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/tags/python?flav=rss.  (I love pyblosxom!)

   The RSS flav is RSS 0.9.1 and it's <em>awful</em>.  I tossed around
   forcing everyone to switch over to RSS 2.0, but then decided not to.
   Anyhow, it's much much better to use the atom flav or the rss20 flav.
   Both of those have dates on the entries and the information in the
   feed itself is better.    Hope that helps.  If not, you know where to
   find me.  /will
