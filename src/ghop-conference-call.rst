As I `wrote over the weekend
<http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/sep-09/ghop-to-run-again.html>`__, the
Google Highly Open Participation contest (intended to get high-school
students involved in open source work) may be run again this winter.
I say "may", because quite a bit of work needs to be done on the
GHOP hosting app, `Melange <http://code.google.com/p/soc/>`__.

We in the Python community are in a uniquely Good position to help out
with this: Melange is written in Python, on Google AppEngine, using
Django.  It would be great were a horde of Django experts to descend
upon Melange to offer their help.  Melange also could use some help
testing; any testing experts out there that want to donate their time?

If you want to get involved, please attend the IRC meeting on 18th
of September 18:00 UTC on #melange.

thanks!
