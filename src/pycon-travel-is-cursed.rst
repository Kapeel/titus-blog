Last year, Grig and I flew down to Dallas together to attend PyCon.  I
don't recall the exact problem, but for some reason the plane didn't
go and we ended up flying through Houston and missing our original
flight to Dallas.  (We did have some unreasonably yummy BBQ in
Houston, so that was an unexpected plus.)

The curse has continued.

Right now, I'm sitting in an airport, using `Boingo
<http://www.boingo.com/>`__ to connect to the Internet (an excellent
$30/mo expenditure, thus far).  My *first* plane was cancelled due
to mechanical malf (an America West gig); I didn't make it off of
standby for my *second* plane; and now, barring oddities, I'm definitely
booked on to a 3:30 flight.

Better luck to the rest of you...

Is anyone reading this who wants to share a taxi ride at ~8:30pm over to
the Dallas Marriott Quorum from DFW?  `E-mail me <mailto:titus@idyll.org>`__ by
2:30pm Pacific time... ;)

   I sure hope this curse doesn't extend to going to San Antonio. Hope
   things are going well at your tutorial.
