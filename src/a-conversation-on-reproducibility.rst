I recently had the pleasure of meeting with Randy LeVeque, Bill Howe,
and Steven Roberts at UW, along with Jory Schossau, after the `UW
bootcamp that Jory and I ran <http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2013-teaching-workshops.html>`__.  I already knew Bill from before
(see `our conversation on VMs and reproducibility <http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/vms-considered-harmful.html>`__) and Steven had
taken the workshop, but this was the first time I'd talked with Randy.
Fernando Perez had introduced us virtually because we were all
interested in scientific reproducibility, and I used the opportunity
to arrange a coffee meeting with Randy.

Randy, Bill, Steven and I have all spent a lot of time thinking about
reproducibility in various ways, and they (among others) at UW are
trying to figure out how to encourage reproducible scientific
practices.  Our conversation was far-ranging and somewhat random --
like all good conversations ;) -- but I wanted to highlight two ideas
that came up.

First, we talked about the idea of *pre-publication* peer review for
reproducibility: group X submits a paper, and group Y reviews that
paper and attempts to reproduce the results in it before it is sent
out to other reviewers.  Then, when it is sent out to other reviewers,
it is sent along with a letter stating that group Y verified the
reproducibility of the paper's results; this lets the other reviewers
can focus on things *other* than reproducibility.  If this could somehow
be married to a shortened time to publication, I think it could be a
winner.

Second, we could run reproducibility "hangouts" where we spend time
going through how specific papers did it.  Some background: the UW
folk are trying to think about how to encourage reproducibility, and
they've had some well-attended meetings on the topic.  Not being at UW
myself (and knowing that even if I were, there are interesting things
going on in many locations), I suggested that perhaps we could do
something online with Google Hangouts or whatnot.  The idea would be
to pick a paper for a given month, and then have several groups spend
part of that month going through the paper and trying to reproduce it.
We could then get together on Google Hangout openly to discuss where
we ran into trouble.  We could (and should) involve the original
authors, if they are interested.  In addition, we could alleviate the
pain and agony of trying to reproduce irreproducible papers by
focusing on papers that claim they *are* reproducible -- that way we'd
learn something about how other people are doing it, and maybe also
find that perhaps they are not as reproducible as the original authors
claimed.

...always nice to chat with people who think this stuff is important :)
