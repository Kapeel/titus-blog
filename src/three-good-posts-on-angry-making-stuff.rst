Over the past year of PyCon, #sciox, and other gender
imbalance/harassment/sexism discussions that I've seen on Twitter and
blogging, I've run into a few posts on these matters that stood out to
me in terms of clarity, logic, and/or good instruction for me.  I'm
sharing them below because I think they're really good, and because
it's time to get them out of my inbox ;).

I'd welcome pointers to other good posts that have affected readers
personally.

The comment section of this blog post isn't the place for critical
discussion of these issues, however; I'm just interested in spreading
the word about these (and other) good posts.  So, I plan to moderate
stricly and ruthlessly.

`The Distress of the Privileged <http://weeklysift.com/2012/09/10/the-distress-of-the-privileged/>`__, by Doug Muder.

This post brought the concept of "privilege" and "distress" home to me
in a really useful way.  I've read plenty of other explanations but this
one stuck in my memory.

`Mixed Up <http://sci2morrow.com/2013/10/16/mixed-up/>`__, by Kathleen Raven.

What I "like" about this post (as in, what makes it super excellent) is
that all of the things on the list are inappropriate and indefensible in
a professional setting.

To quote, """TRUCEConf continually mentions "both sides". What exactly
are these two sides? (Spoiler alert: they don't exist.)"""
