Where are the Zope tutorials?

I've been a hater of Zope (2) for a while, but I hear great things about Zope
3.  I also know that the Zope community contains some of the smartest folks in
Python, so I'm sure Zope 3 is worth hearing about.

So I thought to myself, maybe a 3 hr tutorial on Zope 3 would be a good
investment!

`Umm? <http://pycon.blogspot.com/2008/01/pycon-tutorial-sessions-announced.html>`__

p.s. What I'd *really* like is "An Introduction to How Zope Mangles, Tangles, and Twists Normal Python, For People Who Think They Know Python Already, ThankYouVeryMuch."  And then the same for Twisted.

   We can't make people submit tutorial proposals.    NOTE: Last year
   Jeff Rush gave a 4 day Introduction to Zope3 Sprint. The sprints are
   free and do not require a conference registration.    Not sure if he
   is going to do it again.

   As far as Twisted goes I am trying an Open Space experiment this year
   provisionally entitled "Teach Me Twisted" which reverses the normal
   information flow and has the audience teaching me what I need to know
   to use Twisted. I'm hoping it will be fun - the Twisted community is
   very outgoing and welcoming. Maybe someone could do something similar
   with the Zope 3 crowd?

   There is a talk on the "new" face of Zope 3, Grok, but no full-blown
   tutorials:    <a href="http://us.pycon.org/2008/conference/talks/?sear
   ch=Grok">http://us.pycon.org/2008/conference/talks/?search=Grok</a>
   There are also a few talks on Zope 3 available on plone.tv (although
   none that are really good to recommend as a "intro to Zope 3" type of
   video):    &lt;a href="http://plone.tv/search?SearchableText=zope&amp;
   x=36&amp;y=9"&gt;http://plone.tv/search?SearchableText=zope&amp;x=36&a
   mp;y=9&lt;/a&gt;    One of the prime reasons for Zope 3 was **not** to
   mangle, tangle and twist normal Python :) The interesting lessons from
   Zope 3 for a regular Python person who's just curious as to what
   wisdom may be in the Zope 3 project I believe are in it's design:
   favoring object composition over class inheritance and design by
   contract. Understand the Zope Component Architecture and you will have
   the Zen of Zope 3:    <a href="http://www.muthukadan.net/docs/zca.html
   ">http://www.muthukadan.net/docs/zca.html</a>    Many of the Zope 3
   developers have also spend at lot of time in 2007 working with Python
   eggs, while it's not specific to web frameworks, the tutorial on Eggs
   and Buildout will cover what many Zope developers have been working on
   of late:    <a href="http://us.pycon.org/2008/tutorials/EggsRush/">htt
