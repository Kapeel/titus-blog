The other day, I purchased a new car from the car company down the
street.  This was a small boutique shop, and their marketing brochure
was *slick* -- 0-60 in 6 seconds, heated seats, a good safety rating
-- and the technical reviews were *amazing* -- "Never seen anything
like it! Really novel!"  The car was specifically for road trips, and had all
sorts of whiz-zy GPS functionality and binoculars and good visibility
and a built-in porta-potty.  So I thought I'd give it a try.  The price
was right, and I'd been looking forward to a road trip through the
Upper Peninsula.

When I picked up the car, though, I was a little confused.  One of the doors
had to be held closed, although the company helpfully provided a rubber
band.  The gas tank leaked like a sieve, although (per the company's
manual) "while you need to fill up a bit more frequently than normal,
your road trips will still be fun -- just plan more restroom breaks
at gas stations!" And the steering wheel had a pronounced list to the left,
but that was easily dealt with by applying the rubber band, again.

All in all, though, I was pretty happy with it.  My road trip went
really well while I was on the highway, and let me tell you, this car
was *built* for road trips - very comfy and streamlined.  I did
encounter some trouble on a dirt road -- more specifically, all four
wheels fell off at the first pothole -- but, when I talked to the
company, they pointed out that (a) it was for *road trips*, not
off-roading, and (b) they *had* provided full technical specs as well
as a toolbox and spare parts, so what was I complaining about?
And how could I argue with that?

All in all, I rate this car a solid B-.  Would not buy again.
