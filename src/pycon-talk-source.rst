I've put together a brief discussion, with links to the source code,
surrounding the demos I did at PyCon '07 during my testing tools talk.
Here's a brief TOC: ::

  # Demo 1: Testing CherryPy
  # Demo 2: Testing CherryPy without exec'ing a process
  # Demo 3: Basic code coverage analysis with figleaf
  # Demo 4: More interesting code coverage analysis with nose and figleafsections
  # Demo 5: Writing a simple twill extension to do form "fuzz" testing
  # Demo 6: Django fixtures for twill/wsgi_intercept
  # Demo 7: Recording and examining a Django session with scotch
  # Demo 8: Convert the Django session into a twill script
  # Demo 9: Replaying the Django session from the recording

You can read the discussion at http://darcs.idyll.org/~t/projects/pycon-07-talk-source/README.html.  This document also contains links to download the source code.

Enjoy!
