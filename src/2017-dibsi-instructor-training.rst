As part of our `Summer Institute in Data Intensive Biology
<http://ivory.idyll.org/dibsi/>`__, we will be running a
week-long instructor training from June 18 to June 25 at the
University of California, Davis.

The instructor training will include the following --

* Hands-on training in good pedagogical practice!
* Become a certified Software/Data Carpentry instructor!
* Learn to repurpose and remix online training materials for your own needs!

This workshop is intended for people interested in teaching, reusing
and repurposing the Software Carpentry, Data Carpentry, or `Analyzing
Next-Generation Sequencing Data
<http://angus.readthedocs.io/en/2016/>`__ materials. We envision this
course being most useful to current teaching-intensive faculty, future
teachers and trainers, and core facilities that are developing
training materials.

The workshop fee will be $350 for the week.
Applications will close March 17th.
