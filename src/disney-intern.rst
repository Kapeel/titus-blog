Disney Animation has an opening for a summer intern to work on a testing
project under the supervision of Paul Hildebrandt and Dr. C. Titus Brown.  The
ideal candidate will have experience with a dynamic language supporting
introspection (Python preferred) as well as experience developing unit,
functional, and regression tests, but the ability to learn quickly is the only
requirement.  The work will consist of building a new testing tool for aiding
test automation on large existing code bases.  We expect to release the tool
under an Open Source license.

Please send your CV and a short personal statement to
da-testing-2008@idyll.org, c/o Paul Hildebrandt and C. Titus Brown.

 - BA/BS requested, MA or PhD in-progress desired.
 - Housing stipend provided; competitive hourly wage.
 - 2 months commitment minimum, 3 months preferred.
 - Opportunity for follow-on work or continued employment.

Disney Animation is located in Burbank, CA.

I'll post what I can of the specific project proposal when I have a cleaner version.
