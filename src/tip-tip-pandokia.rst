Victoria Laidler `just announced a Pandokia release
<http://lists.idyll.org/pipermail/testing-in-python/2009-August/002159.html>`__.
She gave a great lightning talk on Pandokia at the PyCon '09 testing BoF and 
I've been looking forward to this release.

Pandokia seems like a nice way to manage test running and results analysis &
reporting, and it fits a fairly unique niche.  Definitely worth taking a look
if you're test-obssessed and have a few minutes.
