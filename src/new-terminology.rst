Some new terminology?

In some discussions with a moderately new Python programmer who seems
to value complexity over simplicity, I may have coined a new term: ::

   "Penis size" style of programming -- the (mistaken) belief that the
   more advanced programming language features you use, the more
   impressive your code will look.

I think it's a fair generalization to say that experienced programmers
value simplicity over complexity, all other things being equal.

A search for "penis size programming" came up with `this link
<http://freewareapp.com/penis-size-o-matic_download/>`__, which is
entertainingly apropos.

p.s. I originally used "dick size", but now that I'm a professor, I have to
be decorous, right?

   the programming equivalent of wearing a phallocarp also surely exists
   ... and that is never going to be pretty

   I have had similar thoughts, but I would express the trend as "the
   (mistaken)) belief that the more difficult to read the code, the more
   advanced the code is".    I do a lot of coding in C and C++ (and
   python too of course) and some of the advanced features make your code
   a lot easier to read, even if it's just a question of using an idiom
   vs hand rolling some fancy schmancy looking crap.      But I think
   we're thinking of the same problem, and I think both of our
   definitions require work in order to be really effective.

   I sense a similar encounter with your future son in his teenage years
   and his retort will be, "But dad I learned it by watching you....." :)
   I am actually going to give this a:    ++1    Implementing complexity
   for the sake of complexity is one of the purest evil's mankind has
   invented, and it is a disease that afflicts IT in general, not just
   Software Engineering.
