OK Folks, I know that planet.python.org and planetpython.org underwent a
merger, and during the merger a new, or patched, or somehow *upgraded* version
of planet went into effect on both.  However, I cannot find a link to the info
post any more.

I would like to put the latest stable version of PlanetPlanet into effect
on the `Google Summer of Code/Python site <http://soc.python.org/>`__ but
I am wary of using the devel repo without any inside info.  (I am
currently running 2.0, which is the latest official release.)

Should I use the dev repo, or should I track down whatever version
planet.python.org is using?

thanks!

   Titus, I was the planetpython.org admin... I used Sam Ruby's fork of
   the planet code called Venus.    <a href="http://intertwingly.net/code
   /venus/">http://intertwingly.net/code/venus/</a>    I haven't the
   foggiest idea the state of the official code.
