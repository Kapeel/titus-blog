This version of the site policy was posted in Oct 2015 and applies
going forward from then.  I'll provide an updated link whenever I
update the policy.

The text was lifted from Captain Awkward's site policy at the URL
http://captainawkward.com/site-policies-and-faqs/ on Oct 19, 2015, and
then modified (significantly) from there.

I'm open to suggestions for additions and removals; please post them
in comments.  However, this set of policies stands until I change them -
thanks for abiding by them!

Copyright Notice
----------------

I own the copyright to all of my writing. Guest bloggers retain their
own copyright. Quote all of us freely!  Link & attribute always!

Questions
---------

By posting your comments to the blog you are granting me the right, in
perpetuity, to use, quote, alter, and/or display those questions and
comments however I see fit both for commercial and non-commercial
distribution. If this concerns you, use a pseudonym and remove
identifying details before you send, or simply post a link to your
own blog.

I do not share your personal email address or identity, with one
exception: People who threaten or harass me or other posters will have
their names, emails, and IP addresses shared with their internet
service providers and, if necessary, law enforcement.

Comments Policy
---------------

We moderate things in these here parts. Not every point of view
deserves to be heard. Unmoderated spaces tend to be full of assholes.

Anonymous posting is allowed. Using a consistent identity is encouraged.

Your comments will theoretically show up immediately, though the spam
filter may eat legitimate comments, even by regular posters.  Alert me
via e-mail at t@idyll.org if one of your comments doesn't appear.

Of course, sometimes comments don't show up because I delete
them. This is a dictatorship, and I can delete any comment at any time
for any reason, and I have no time for rules lawyers. There may not be
a warning or explanation of why your comment was deleted.

A non-comprehensive list of some common reasons comments are deleted:

- You're derailing a thread.

- The discussion has become uncivil and has devolved into personal
  insults, threats, advocating violence, or turned into a pile-on.

- Sarcasm, curse words, gentle mocking, criticism and vehement
  disagreement are generally allowed, as long as the overall spirit is
  constructive and in good faith.

- You're otherwise being useless, uninformative, or destructive.

Having your comment deleted or being asked to stop commenting in a
particular thread or to move on from a topic of discussion is IN NO
WAY an invitation for you to send me lengthy emails detailing your
thoughts. If I wanted to read Your Thoughts I would have let you keep
posting them.

You can always reach me at t@idyll.org or on Twitter at @ctitusbrown.
