I recently had the pleasure of being the technical reviewer for a new
Apress offering, **Beginning Python Visualization**, by Shai Vaingast.

To quote from the `apress page <http://www.apress.com/book/view/9781430218432>`__,

  What you'll learn:

    * Write ten lines of code and present visual information instead of data soup.
    * Set up an open source environment ready for data visualization.
    * Forget Excel: use Python.
    * Learn numerical and textual processing.
    * Draw graphs and plots based on textual and numerical data.
    * Learn how to deal with images.

I can't recommend this book highly enough for people who need to do
basic data processing, manipulation, and viewing in Python.  My role
as TR was largely limited to occasional style issues and some serious
cheerleading: "more figures! more examples! great stuff!"

So, in sum: **buy this book.**

Note that apress didn't ask me to review this, and they only paid me
for the TR role.  This blog post is gratis and I was slow enough on
the reviews that I suspect they won't ask me to TR again no matter
what I say ;).
