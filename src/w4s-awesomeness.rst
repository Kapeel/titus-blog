It's been fun to watch (and occasionally help drive) science moving
online and taking advantage of the Web.  Here are some of my favorite
examples.

1. Simple, easy ways of sharing process abound.  Github, bitbucket,
   and sourceforge are, ultimately, ways to share your *research
   process* with executable code.  More generally, the open source
   ethos has sloooowly started to permeate academia.  Huzzah.

2. IPython Notebook has enabled easy executable papers, and is
   changing the practice of data analysis.  See `diginorm
   <http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/replication-i.html>`__ and `the
   QIIME/ipynb paper <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23096404>`__
   in particular.  Open, easily reproducible pubs!  In my lifetime!

   BTW, is it just me, or is there extreme irony in Elsevier pushing
   `executable papers <http://www.executablepapers.com/>`__?

3. `arXiv <http://arxiv.org/>`__.

   Physicists have been using arXiv for decades to post their papers
   publicly, prior to peer review.  It's `starting to catch on in some
   parts of biology, too
   <http://www.nature.com/news/geneticists-eye-the-potential-of-arxiv-1.11091>`__.

4. `Haldane's Sieve <http://haldanessieve.org/>`__

   Haldane's Sieve is a blog started by Graham Coop and Joe Pickrell
   that posts paper titles and abstracts from the q-bio section of
   arXiv, with the goal of enabling comments and discussion.

   `This discussion
   <http://haldanessieve.org/2012/10/02/horizontal-gene-transfer-may-explain-variation-in-%CE%B8s/>`__
   on Haldane's Sieve, and the followup discussion and `blog post
   <http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/rohan-on-weird-patterns.html>`__ by
   Rohan, and then the `follow-on arXiv post
   <http://haldanessieve.org/2012/11/06/response-to-horizontal-gene-transfer-may-explain-variation-in-%CE%B8s/>`__
   by the original authors, is a stunning example that exemplifies
   what we should be doing on *every* paper.

5. `Retraction Watch <http://retractionwatch.wordpress.com/>`__.

   Making the scientific process more visible, one depressing story at a
   time.
    
6. Experiments in crowd funding.

   Wouldn't it be nice if some science, at least, could be funded
   directly by people who thought it was cool?  `Ethan Perlstein did
   that
   <http://www.perlsteinlab.com/round-table/crowdfund-my-meth-lab-yo>`__.

7. The general increase in science blogging and tweeting by scientists.

   'nuff said... right?

8. Open Access.

   The rise of Open Access has been nothing short of astonishing.
   Covered adequately elsewhere, though :)

9. Rental compute.

   I love being able to `point scientists at an AMI and say, sure, re-run my
   analysis from scratch, it'll cost ya 8 bucks
   <http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/replication-i.html>`__.  Super
   enabling.

10. Mechanical turk and other cheap labor.

    It's hard to know where `this <http://experimentalturk.wordpress.com/>`__
    is going, but I bet it'll be cool.

12. Data archiving sites.

    Isn't it nice to know that you can access `all the data <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/>`__?  Anytime you want?  A friend told me to specifically mention `Dryad <http://datadryad.org/>`__.

13. Increasingly sophisticated front ends to massive amounts of scientific data.

    Being able to `explore genomes <http://genome.ucsc.edu/>`__ and
    `extract custom reports
    <http://www.ensembl.org/info/data/biomart.html>`__ from masses of
    genomic data, whenever I want, is pretty neat.

    I'm sure there are whiz-bang-ier examples, but these are pretty cool 'cause
    they work and they're used.
