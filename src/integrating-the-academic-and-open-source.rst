`This post <http://gettys.wordpress.com/2008/11/04/time-to-lead/>`__ on why
academics should work to integrate their research ideas with open source
software in order to actually push forward on the OSS side (and presumably vice
versa) is really good.  I think such things could be applied in software
testing, too, where there's a gulf between how academics think and what people
actually use.  I was impressed with `Dr. Tao Xie's work on PEX and Fitnex
<http://people.engr.ncsu.edu/txie/>`__ with respect to testing, and I'm talking
with him about applying it to Python.
