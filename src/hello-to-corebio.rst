I've said some mean things about BioPython_ in the past -- that it's
broken, that it's crufty, etc.  One prominent former BioPython
developer responded with the very reasonable question of why I wasn't
fixing it, if it was so broken.  The answer, of course, is that I've
been working on my PhD, and for some very sound reasons I didn't want
to put in the effort yet.

Luckily Gavin Crooks was under no such constraint, and he put together
corebio_.  This last week, he and I and some other local
bioinformaticians connected, and we're going to try to turn corebio
into a replacement for some of the core functionality of BioPython.

If you're a Python programmer who is into bioinformatics, we'd love to
have you.  please contact me_ or Gavin Crooks to join the corebio
mailing list.  The more the merrier!

   Let's see if this comment goes through. Cool to see corebio using
   Google Code BTW.
