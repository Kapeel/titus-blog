From `Wages or Shortage <http://meganmcardle.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/04/wages_or_shortage_1.php>`__, this comment ::

   """
   A-grade engineers are unfortunately similar to Welsh
   longbowmen: devastatingly potent compared to their peers, but you
   have to start their training at age 10 or so.  Simply upping the
   salaries of A-grade engineers won't magically create more of them.
   We know this, as we tried exactly that experiment in the boom."
   """

and this comment ::

  """
  ... the notion of "best practices" is widely misunderstood in IT. It
  is not organizational best practices that most improve the output,
  it's best engineering practices. And those are accepted first by the
  "rockstar" types and least understood, why, most often resisted, by
  the management and subsistence engineers. Where do you think that
  10-20x gap comes from, lightning-fast typing skill? ;-)
  """

and this one ::

   """
   ... such practices often fall victim to the hero mentality that is
   the odious legacy of the dot-com boom. It basically says that for a
   tech company to do well, it has to find some rockstars, clear the
   decks for them, and sell the gold that trickles out of their
   foosball-table equipped office. It fosters a warlike mentality in
   the workplace and sacrifices long term growth for short term market
   share. It also happily sacrifices a vast middle ground of engineers
   who would improve and be profitably productive with a positive
   environment and some solid mentoring so it can lavish luxury on the
   super-productive who may not, as Dave seems to concede, necessarily
   add business value. Contrary to Dave's assertions, I've also seen
   good engineers get better in such an environment.
   """

all ring true.

   Hey,    yeah, some people can just do things better.  Not saying I'm
   one of them :)    It's like the old "100 monkeys typing on 100 type
   writers for 100 years will never be able to write something as good as
   shakespear wrote down the pub one night when he was pissed and had a
   sore tooth".    But maybe if shakespear was allowed to tell the
   monkeys what to do... with fruit bribes perhaps... then the
   monkeys+shakespear could do some good stuff.  Like if the monkeys were
   given good monkey type writers, and were sent off to monkey typing
   class to learn how to type better.  Or would the monkeys just slow
   shakespear down?    If only shakespear could live again, and be given
   100 monkeys and unlimited fruit... we could finally know the answer to
   this question.      -Rsd.

   Somehow the phrase "rockstar programmer" always makes me think of this
   post:    <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000552.htm
   l">http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000552.html</a>    and
   the one it quotes:    "There is no such thing as a 'Rock Star
   Programmer,' so if you want to become one, you already have problems
   that reading a blog post can't fix.  Rock stars get sex, drugs,
   parties, limousines, fame, glory, dates with supermodels, and Rolling
   Stone covers.  Good programmers get ... uh ... fewer compiler errors."

   Ever gone looking for the evidence to back up the claim that the best
   programmers are X times more productive (where "X" varies from quote
   to quote, and "than whom" is rarely specified)?

   So there's hope for us mere mortals, and I should keep trying to learn
   how to implement automated tests.  Cool.  I was about to give up and
   join the French Foreign Legion.
