I'm at PyCon, and I have a tip for people: don't stay at the same
hotel as everyone else.

My hotel room Internet connection is *great*, perhaps in part because
I'm not sharing it with the rest of the PyCon attendees!  (Plus it's
free -- the DoubleTree wireless Internet doesn't charge you for a
connection, unlike the Crowne Plaza hotel that's hosting PyCon.)

I look forward to seeing everyone from last year & meeting new people;
look me up, guys!

   Hrm, my wifi in the lobby is great, and I didn't have to log in or
   anything like that...     BTW, looking forward to your tutorial in
   (checks) an hour!

   Okay, I concede the point: once we got int the tutorial room, it took
   me forever to connect. But I did eventually get on... obviously :D
