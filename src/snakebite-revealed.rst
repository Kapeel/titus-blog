As `Jesse writes
<http://jessenoller.com/2009/01/27/snakebiteorg-the-open-source-dev-network/>`__,
Trent `revealed the existence of Snakebite yesterday
<http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-committers/2009-January/000331.html>`__.
`Snakebite <http://www.snakebite.org/>`__ is an "open network" of
various machines that Trent and others (myself included) are making
available to the Python community for build and debug purposes.  I'm
coordinating the MSU component, which basically means that I run
interference for Trent with MSU higher-ups and provide power &
network; Trent bought almost all of the machines himself on e-bay and
has done 99.9% of the work so far.

And that's pretty much the entire story, minus the blood, guts, and
delivery of excessively large quantities of excessively large boxes to
my doorstep here at MSU...

There will be a discussion session about Snakebite at PyCon '09, so
stay tuned.

Incidentally,one of the real pleasures of being a professor is that I get to
throw my support behind worthy projects like this one.  MSU has been amazingly
good so far, and the Computer Science department in particular has opened their
doors for us.  Here's to an open source future here at MSU, and elsewhere too!
