For anyone who actually wants to know what it is I do, I've updated my
lab Web site, http://ged.msu.edu/, to be a bit more representative of
what it is we're doing these days.  (I wrote it over three years ago,
so it's been becoming increasingly dated.) In particular,

 * I put up my `reappointment essay
   <http://ged.msu.edu/downloads/2011-reappointment.pdf>`__, in which
   I explain to Those Who Judge what my career goals are and why they
   should keep me around (short version: because I'm awesome! longer
   version: read the PDF).

 * I've posted a couple of grant proposals on the `interests page
   <http://ged.msu.edu/interests.html>`__

 * our `list of interests <http://ged.msu.edu/interests.html>`__ has been
   updated;

etc.  Probably should update the list of students/lab members a bit, too...
hrm.

I also added something special to the "joining the lab" bit so that I can
delete the more silly "I want you to hire me" spam that I get from
wannabe students.
