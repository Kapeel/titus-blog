I haven't set up tagging/categories yet, nor do I want to make the commenting
functionality public because of the EEVIL SPAMMERS.  So I'll wait to make
this public.

Ultimately, of course, it will serve as a replacement for my `old blog`_.

   Hi Titus, could you add an Atom or RSS feed ?  That  would be great.
   Thanks anyway for your posts (and your work on twill).
