So I'm having a little caption contest for this picture of our
daughter, Amarie Rose Brown, who is now nearly 6 weeks old (but only
four weeks old in this picture).

Captions so far:

1. "We thought she'd be easier to find, this way."

2. "Well, **someone** certainly got lucky."

3. "Google recruiting is getting pretty speculative!"

If you'd like you can also suggest a reasonable award for a good
caption.  I don't have any ideas; daddy sleep deprivation has put me
in an interesting fugue state.

p.s. Props to Leslie Hawthorn at Google for sending me the swag!

p.p.s. Other cute baby swag welcome.  She's in the 0-3 mo range now.
