Course Description

This intensive two week summer course will introduce students with a strong
biology background to the practice of analyzing short-read sequencing data from
the Illumina GA2 and other next-gen platforms. The first week will introduce
students to computational thinking and large-scale data analysis on UNIX
platforms. The second week will focus on mapping, assembly, and analysis of
short-read data for resequencing, ChIP-seq, and RNAseq.

No prior programming experience is required, although familiarity with some
programming concepts is suggested, and bravery in the face of the unknown is
necessary. 2 years or more of graduate school in a biological science is
strongly suggested.
