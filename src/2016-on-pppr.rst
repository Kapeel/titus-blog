CORRECTION: I mistakenly linked to `Geoff Bilder, Jennifer Lin, and
Cameron's piece on infrastructure
<http://cameronneylon.net/blog/principles-for-open-scholarly-infrastructures/>`__
in the first posted version, rather than Cameron's post on `culture in
data sharing
<http://cameronneylon.net/blog/taking-culture-seriously-the-challenges-of-data-sharing/>`__.  Both are worth reading but the latter is more relevant to this post, and I also wanted to make sure I correctly attributed the former to Geoff, Jennifer, and Cameron all.

----

I am a huge fan of the idea of changing up scientific peer review.

Anyone paying attention has seen a nigh-daily drumbeat of blog posts,
tweets, and op-eds pointing out the shortcomings of the current
approach, which is dominated by anonymous pre-publication peer review.

For those who don't know how the current system works, it goes
something like this:

1. Author submits paper to journal

2. Journal finds editor for paper.

3. Editor decides whether paper is important enough to review, finds reviewers for paper.

4. Reviewers review paper, send reviews to editor.

5. Editor collates reviews, anonymizes them, and sends them to authors along
   with a decision (reject, major revisions, minor revisions, accept).

6. Go to #1 (it it's a reject), or go to #4 (if revisions required), or go to...

7. Publish!

8. Garner academic fame, reap grant money, write another paper, go to #1.

This is how much of scientific communication works, and peer-reviewed
pubs are how reputation is garnered and credit is assigned.

There are many concerns with this approach in the modern day world,
with all the possibilities enabled by the Intertubes - papers are
often not available prior to publication, which delays scientific
progress; journals are often unnecessarily expensive, with high profit
margins; papers have to find big effects to be considered significant enough
to even review; reviewers are often inexpert, usually uncompensated, rarely
timely, and sometimes quite obnoxious; the reviews are rarely
published, which means the reviewer perspective is rarely heard;
reviews are not re-used, so when a paper transitions from journal to
journal, the reviews must be redone; editors make incomprehensible
decisions; the process is slow; the process if opaque; there's little
accountability; and probably many other things that I am missing.

A precis might be that, so far, publishing and peer review have really
failed to take deep advantage of the opportunities provided by quick,
easy, instantaneous worldwide communication.

In recognition of this idea that there may be better ways to do
communicate science, I've indulged in lots of experiments in
alt-publishing since becoming an Assistant Professor - I blog and
tweet a lot, I sign my reviews, I (used to) post many of my reviews on
my blog, I've been trying out `F1000Research
<http://f1000research.com/>`__'s open review system, most of our
papers are written openly & blogged & preprinted, I've indulged in
`authorship experiments
<http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2015-authorship-on-software-papers.html>`__,
and we've tried pre- and post-publication peer review in journal clubs
and on my blog.

As a result of all of these experiments, I've learned a lot about how
the system works and reacts to attempts to change.  It's mostly been
positive (and I certainly have no complaints about my career
trajectory).  But the main conclusion I've reached is a tentative and
disappointing one - the whole system is complicated, and is deeply
rooted in the surprisingly conservative culture of science.  And,
because of this, I don't think there's a simple way to cut the Gordian
Knot and move quickly to a new publication system.

In recent weeks, Michael Eisen has `been very vocal about changing to
a system of post-publication peer review (PPPR)
<https://storify.com/mbeisen/mbeisen-pollyp1-plans-for-asapbio>`__.
(Also see `this more detailed blog post
<http://www.michaeleisen.org/blog/?p=1820>`__.)  This morning, I
objected to some snark directed at Michael and other PPPR advocates,
and this led to a decent amount of back and forth on Twitter (see
`this tweet and descendants
<https://twitter.com/ctitusbrown/status/699240517163311104>`__).
But, of course, Twitter isn't great for conveying complicated positions,
so I thought I'd take to the blogs.

Below, I tried to distill my opinions down to three main points.
Let's see how it goes.

1. Practice in this area is still pretty shallow in science.
------------------------------------------------------------

I don't think we have enough experience to make decisions yet.  We need
more experiments.

There's (IMO) legitimate confusion over questions like anonymity and
platform.  The question of metrics (qualitative or quantitative) rears
its ugly head - when is something adequately peer reviewed, and when
does something "count" in whatever way it needs to count?  And how are
we supposed to evaluate a deeply technical paper that's outside of our
field?  What if it has a mixture of good and bad reviews?  How do we
focus our attention on papers outside of our immediate sphere? Anyone
who thinks hard about these things and reaches a simple conclusion is
kidding themselves.

(Of course, the fun bit is that if you think hard about these things you
quickly reach the conclusion that our current practice is horrible, too.
But that doesn't mean new practices are automatically better.)

2. The Internet is not a friendly place, and it takes a lot of work to create well-behaving communities.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As my corner of science has struggled to embrace "online", I've
watched scientists recap the same mistakes that many open source and
social media communities made over the last two decades.

The following is a good generalization, in my experience:

Any worthwhile community these days has active (if light) moderation,
a code of conduct laying out the rules, and a number of active
participants who set the tone and invite new people into the
community.  These communities take time to grow and cannot be created
by fiat.

I think any proposal for PPPR needs to explicitly address the
questions of methods of moderation, selection of moderators, expected
conduct, and what to do with bad actors.  It also needs to address
community growth and sustainability.  The latter questions are where
most PPPR commenters focus, but the former questions are critical as well.

3. Scholarship in this area is still pretty young.
--------------------------------------------------

There are a lot of knee jerk reactions (PPPR good! PPPR bad! I like
blue!), but there isn't a lot of scholarship and discussion in this
area, and most of it happens on blogs (which are largely invisible to
99% of scientists). There are only a few people thinking hard about
the whole picture; I really like some of `Cameron Neylon's posts
<http://cameronneylon.net/blog/taking-culture-seriously-the-challenges-of-data-sharing/>`__, for example, but the fact that his work stands out to me so much is
(to me) a bad sign.  (I think that's a compliment to you and a diss on the
field as a whole, Cameron ;).

Worse, I've been entirely spoiled by reading `Gabriella Coleman's book
on Anonymous, "Hacker, Hoaxer, Whistleblower, Spy"
<http://www.amazon.com/Hacker-Hoaxer-Whistleblower-Spy-Anonymous/dp/1781685835>`__.
This kind of deep, immersive research and reporting on how
technological communities operate is hard to find, and most of what I
have found is ignorant of the new uses and opportunities of
technology.  I've found nothing equivalent on science. (Pointers VERY
welcome!)

Concluding thoughts
-------------------

At the end of the day, it's not clear to me that we will ever have an
answer to `Goodhart's Law
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law>`__ -- "when a measure
becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure."  There are
tremendous pressures (livelihoods, reputation, funding) that will be
placed on any system of peer review and publishing. I worry that any
system we come up with will be even more easily perverted than the
current system has been, and science (and scientists, and scientific
progress) will suffer as a result.

Me? I'm going to continue experimenting, and talking with people, and
seeing if I can identify and promulgate good practice from the bottom
up.  'cause that's how I roll.

p.s. The reason I'm not posting reviews on my blog anymore has to do
with time and energy - I've been overwhelmed for the last year or two.
I think I need a better workflow for posting them that takes less of
my focus.
