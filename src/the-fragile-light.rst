Just finished the book `The Fragile Light
<http://www.fragilelight.com/>`__, by David Nurenberg.
Good stuff; independent author.  Worth reading.

Briefly, it's a SF&F novel about a world where mutants are sometimes
heroes, and more often feared; where there are Herotown ghettoes full
of supers; and where only licensed heroes can join in the game.  It
reminds me a bit of the early Wild Cards books, but better written. A
fun read.

   You might also like "Soon I Will Be Invincible" --- the hero parts
   plod a little, but the villain is great.
