Chairing a Web Panel at PyCon

After learning from Jeff Rush that no one had volunteered (yet) to organize
a panel on Web technologies, I stepped up to the plate.  I've also
submitted a talk proposal about twill/scotch/figleaf and (with Grig)
I'm going to submit a proposal for a testing tutorial, so attendees may
well get tired of hearing my voice.  I would be happy if someone else
would volunteer to run the panel, hint, hint...

The panel I'm planning to organize is the `Web Frameworks panel
<http://us.pycon.org/TX2007/WebFrameworksPanel>`__.  The idea is to
get a few authors/maintainers of Web frameworks up on a podium and ask
them questions about their framework and its relations to other
frameworks.  A few questions are already up on the Web Frameworks panel
page.  It sounds like we might be able to score a lunch slot, too, given
sufficient effort.

I must admit to having a complete lapse of creativity at the moment,
so I'm hoping that I can solicit a few things from the Python community:

 - what web frameworks are you interested in seeing represented?
   (and who should I contact as the maintainer?)

 - what questions would you like to have asked?

 - what format do you think the panel should be?  Pre-selected questions,
   open floor, etc.?

Let me know...

thanks,

   Re: format -- I think pre-selected questions, presented to the
   panelists ahead of time.  I hate panels where everyone just dorks
   around given questions that aren't very interesting (over-specific or
   over-general) or require too much thought to answer on the fly and in
   a concise manner (leading to pithy or babbly answers).

   I sort of agree -- but I thought the Steve Holden interview of Bram
   Cohen (last year) was a bit too staged.  It would be interesting to go
   for a mix  of preselected and last minute.  Hmm, I see some
   opportunities for Web tech coming in ;)    --titus

   The requirements for the Panel discussion include having the outline
   (questions and bullets) per determined as part of the proposal/review
   process.    The full instructions are on the Call For Proposals page:
   <a href="http://us.pycon.org/TX2007/CallForProposals">http://us.pycon.
   org/TX2007/CallForProposals</a>      'A panel discussion is one in
   which a group of people discuss a list of pre-determined topics or
   bullet points.'    A list of discussion topics like:    o describe the
   framework and the key problems it solves in 60 seconds or less.    o
   What are the rationals behind the different template systems:
   Zope/Plone ZPT (XML based)    Django (customizable designer centric)
   Pyjamas    CherryPy    Myghty (a programming language in its own
   right)    o To CMS or not to CMS?    o mixing the frameworks    (talk
   of TG and Django merging, Plone + PHP was a major bullet at last years
   Plone keynote, etc)    o cross pollination between the frameworks
   (features are being borrowed from other projects, there are developers
   working on contributing to TG, Django, and Plone at the same time...)
   These topics will definatly NOT limit the discussion, each could have
   a 1/2 hour devoted to them, (well except the first one).    As for the
   frameworks:    Zope    Plone    Turbo Gears (TG)    Django    Paste

   I suspect (with cause) that PyCon is willing to be flexible...
   Certainly those frameworks (with the possible exception of Paste --
   have to figure out how that categorizes, and talk with Ian a bit) all
   qualify.

   If discussing "What are the rationals behind the different template
   systems", it would make sense to add QP/Quixote to the mix, since
   their approach to "templating" is rather the inverse of most.

   Don't forget pylons....

   My company played with all the frameworks mentioned above (including
   Pylons) and we use (or have used) Zope and Plone internally. We are
   currently building a hosted version of some of our technology - that
   requires a very rich UI. Our prototype is being built with Quixote and
   JQuery with other components being selected soon. So far that's
   turning out to be a great choice.    One possibility is to view this
   from the end goal perspective. What type of web enabled system is
   being built. How do you select the components (or frameworks)
   accordingly. What are some "patterns of design and/or use" that others
   can benefit from.
