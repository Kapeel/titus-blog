"Open Source, Open Science" Meeting report - March 2015.
########################################################

On March 19th and 20th, the `Center for Open Science <>`__ hosted a
small meeting in Charlottesville, VA, convened by COS and co-organized
by Kaitlin Thaney (Mozilla Science Lab) and Titus Brown (UC Davis).  A
number of people working across the open science ecosystem attended,
including publishers, infrastructure non-profits, academics, public
policy experts, community builders, and academics.

The purpose of the meeting was to advance open science more generally
by coordinating around common efforts and discuss common challenges.
One particularly exciting aspect of the meeting was the recognition
that open science was becoming ever higher profile, with the entry of
several new foundations into the space and the prioritization of data
sharing by the White House.

We had good discussions about several issues at the intersection of
technology and social hacking, including badging, API development, and
shared infrastructure.  During a closed session under "Chatham House"
rules, we also shared stories of challenges in coordination created
by the increasingly fractured community.

A repeated theme was the question of how to make the value proposition
of open science more explicit - why should scientists become more
open, and why should institutions and funders support open science?
There was general recognition that incentives in science were
misaligned with open science, and we discussed particular pain points
and where there could be opportunities for realigning incentives.
Particular value was placed on providing information about the
benefits of open science to researchers, funders, and administrators,
with an emphasis on self-interested reasons; we also discussed industry
interest in "open", both in making good use of open data, and also in
participating in the open ecosystem.

Training came up throughout, and we discussed some methods of coordinating
training activities, with perhaps a training "decision tree" defining
potential entry points and next steps for researchers.

The challenge of supporting broad "keystone" training
efforts such as Software Carpentry was linked to the larger challenge
of funding the so-called "glue" - the technical infrastructure that is
only noticed when it fails to function.

Another repeated theme was that of the "bubble" - many participants in the
meeting felt that they were failing to reach people outside of the open
science community.  Training in data science and software development was
recognized as one way to introduce people to open science from outside
this bubble - data integration and techniques for reproducible computational
analysis naturally connect to discussions of data availability and open source.
Re-branding was also discussed as a solution - rather than "post preprints!",
say "get more citations!"  Another point that was well received was that
researchers who engage with open practices need not and indeed may not 
want to self-identify as "open scientists."

A number of concrete actions and collaborative activities emerged at
the end, including a more coordinated effort around badging and the
writing of an opinion paper outlining the value proposition of open
science for researchers, specifically.  While several proposals were
advanced for "next meetings", no decision was reached.
