Over the last few months, I've been playing with `hypothes.is
<http://hypothes.is>`__ and thinking about how to use it to further my
scientific work.  This resulted in some brainstorming with Jon Udell
and Maryann Martone about, well, lots of things.  And now we're putting
in an open science prize entry!

tl; dr? Check out a draft of our proposal to `the open science prize
<https://www.openscienceprize.org>`__ competition, `"Annotation as a
service: helping build a global knowledge layer with annotation of the
dark literature" <https://2016-aesir.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`__.

What is Hypothes.is?
--------------------

If you're not familiar with hypothes.is, it's an awesome,
game-changing system that lets you add (and view) annotations to
virtually any Web page or PDF document.  The key bit is that it's
utterly permissionless - the hypothes.is service is completely
client-side, so you can add and view annotations on any content to
which you have access.  For example, if you're reading this blog post
in a hypothes.is compatible browser (try Firefox or Google Chrome),
you should see this sentence highlighted; click on it and you should
see an annotation window pop out with some text in it.

Hypothes.is lets me decorate papers (including closed access papers)
manually with whatever I want.

More specifically, hypothes.is lets me connect any two resources with
an "anchor" in one, pointing to another, with some text and tags.
This can be done manually.  It's done without permission by either
resource - as long as the resource has an ID (URL or PDF ID), it
works.

So what's the #openscienceprize entry about?
--------------------------------------------

We want to expand this concept to the notion of automated annotation,
where any source of textual analysis (including links to database,
reviews, post-publication-date updates, etc.) can be used to create
annotations for any given piece of literature, linking it to relevant
resources, metacommentary, etc.

I don't know of anything like this currently and so it's not easy to
describe how it's useful.  The first use case, Wormbase, is one
example - right now, Wormbase can't place links to their gene
information on the lit, but with this they could do so quite easily.
More generally, I see this as opening the floodgates for rampant
creativity to be applied to marking up scientific papers.

We'd love your feedback on the idea, along with any brainstorming or
critiques you might have. Please go check out the proposal at
https://2016-aesir.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ and let us know what you think!
