Dear Sir,

I am Mary Grantsman, the program manager for a large federal funding
program in the United States.  I most solicit your confidence in what
I am about to tell you. This is by virtue of its nature as being
highly confidential and urgent.

I am looking for a reliable and reputable person to handle a
confidential research program.  A leading university professor and
statesman, a citizen of your country until his death, banked and had a
closing balance of Eighteen Million United States Dollars in a fixed
deposit account.

Which the bank unquestionably expects to be claimed by any available
academic collaborator of the late beneficiary. Also I would want us to
invest this fund in your lab on research into cancer.  I would
like to discuss with you in regards to this deal.

In your reply please tell me more about yourself and include your
telephone number and university bank account number for easy
communication.
