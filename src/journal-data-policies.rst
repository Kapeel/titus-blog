`Science <http://www.sciencemag.org/site/feature/contribinfo/prep/gen_info.xhtml#dataavail>`__:

   Data and materials availability All data necessary to understand,
   assess, and extend the conclusions of the manuscript must be
   available to any reader of Science. All computer codes involved in
   the creation or analysis of data must also be available to any
   reader of Science. After publication, all reasonable requests for
   data and materials must be fulfilled. Any restrictions on the
   availability of data, codes, or materials, including fees and
   original data obtained from other sources (Materials Transfer
   Agreements), must be disclosed to the editors upon submission. If
   there are any MTAs pertaining to data or materials produced in this
   research, or that you have agreed to in conducting the research
   that restrict you from providing data or materials, please describe
   these and send the editor of your manuscript a copy of these
   specific MTAs. Fossils or other rare specimens must be deposited in
   a public museum or repository and available for research.

`Nature <http://www.nature.com/authors/policies/availability.html>`__:

   An inherent principle of publication is that others should be able
   to replicate and build upon the authors' published
   claims. Therefore, a condition of publication in a Nature journal
   is that authors are required to make materials, data and associated
   protocols promptly available to readers without undue
   qualifications. Any restrictions on the availability of materials
   or information must be disclosed to the editors at the time of
   submission. Any restrictions must also be disclosed in the
   submitted manuscript, including details of how readers can obtain
   materials and information. If materials are to be distributed by a
   for-profit company, this must be stated in the paper.

   ...

   Data sets must be made freely available to readers from the date of
   publication, and must be provided to editors and peer-reviewers at
   submission, for the purposes of evaluating the manuscript.

`PNAS <http://www.pnas.org/site/misc/iforc.shtml/#ix>`__

   Materials and Data Availability. To allow others to replicate and
   build on work published in PNAS, authors must make materials, data,
   and associated protocols available to readers. Authors must
   disclose upon submission of the manuscript any restrictions on the
   availability of materials or information. Data not shown and
   personal communications cannot be used to support claims in the
   work. Authors are encouraged to use SI to show all necessary
   data. Authors are encouraged to deposit as much of their data as
   possible in publicly accessible databases. Such deposition may
   facilitate access to data during the review process and
   postpublication. Fossils or other rare specimens must be deposited
   in a museum or repository and be made available to qualified
   researchers for examination.

   Authors must make Unique Materials (e.g., cloned DNAs; antibodies;
   bacterial, animal, or plant cells; viruses; and algorithms and
   computer codes) promptly available on request by qualified
   researchers for their own use. Failure to comply will preclude
   future publication in the journal. It is reasonable for authors to
   charge a modest amount to cover the cost of preparing and shipping
   the requested material. Contact pnas@nas.edu if you have difficulty
   obtaining materials.

`PLoS <http://www.plosone.org/static/guidelines.action>`__:

   Under 'Materials and Methods',

   This section should provide enough detail to allow suitably skilled
   investigators to fully replicate your study. Specific information
   and/or protocols for new methods should be included in detail. If
   materials, methods, and protocols are well established, authors may
   refer to other papers where those protocols are described in
   detail, but the submission should include sufficient information to
   be understood independent of these references.

   ...

   Methods sections of papers with data that should be deposited in a
   publicly available database should specify where the data have been
   deposited and provide the relevant accession numbers and version
   numbers, if appropriate. Accession numbers should be provided in
   parentheses after the entity on first use. If the accession numbers
   have not yet been obtained at the time of submission, please state
   that they will be provided during review. They must be provided
   prior to publication.

New England Journal of Medicine -- cannot find anything.

`BioMedCentral <http://www.biomedcentral.com/about/supportingdata>`__:

   Submission of a manuscript to a BioMed Central journal implies that
   readily reproducible materials described in the manuscript,
   including all relevant raw data, will be freely available to any
   scientist wishing to use them for non-commercial purposes. Well
   established and widely supported databases exist for certain types
   of data such as nucleic acid sequences, protein sequences, and
   atomic coordinates; information on which can be found below and in
   journal instructions for authors and 'about' pages. An increasing
   number of research funding agencies also now support data sharing
   in the life sciences.

   ...
   
   BioMed Central understands that it is not always possible or appropriate to openly share data, in some biomedical fields, so the 'Availability of supporting data' section is not required, or encouraged, in all journals; please see the journal's information for authors for specific manuscript formatting requirements. We recognize that the decision to mandate data deposition as a condition of publication is a decision best made by the scientific community a journal serves. The 'Availability of supporting data' section is a tool for editors, authors and scientific communities to, at the appropriate time, put data deposition policies into practice.
