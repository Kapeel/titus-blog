Just got news that the `BEACON NSF Science and Technology Center for
the study of Evolution in Action <http://www.beacon.msu.edu/>`__
funded `Chris Adami <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Adami>`__ to
come do a sabbatical here at Michigan State University for the next
year.  This puts me, Chris, and `Charles Ofria
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Ofria>`__ at the same
institution (now MSU, then Caltech) for the first time since 1993,
other than a brief overlap in ~2000.  1993 was when we designed and
implemented `Avida <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avida>`__.  (Avida
must be one of the most long-lived summer research projects ever...)

Should I be upset that Charles and Chris both have Wikipedia pages,
and Charles is an Associate Professor and Chris a full Professor,
while I am only a lowly Assistant Prof, even though I'm only a year
younger than Charles?  Naah -- I don't have any grey hair yet.  I'll
take the trade... ;)

The "family" has also grown.  We are all married, 2 of us have kids,
and we all have a bunch of students and postdocs, too.  It's gettin'
crowded around here: should be fun!
