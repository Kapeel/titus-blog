Privacy Invasion is Good?

The Slashdot forum managers have approved yet another troll message:
In `Cameras Help Cops Catch a Killer
<http://yro.slashdot.org/yro/07/01/03/0242224.shtml>`__, they ask
whether or not the use of cameras to help catch **a** killer justifies
the increasing use of surveillance in public spaces.

The answer is "no".

There are a couple of ways to think about this, and at least one of them
points to a big flaw in the way we carry out public discourse.

First, let's consider the social implications.  Suppose you say that
surveillance *is* good, and we should install cameras everywhere, even
in living rooms, bedrooms, and bathrooms. Wouldn't this prevent *all*
crimes?!  (No, it probably wouldn't; criminals adapt too, you know.)  And,
even if it did, privacy and solitude is a prized commodity: not something
I want to yield on the off chance that it will solve a crime.

The more compelling argument IMO is to run the numbers.  These
arguments tend to focus on the "true positive" rate -- the number of
crimes solved (sometimes spectacularly) by the use of the nifty tech
-- but that's only 1 of four numbers you should consider.  We also
need to look at "true negatives" (how many innocent people are you
surveilling?)
"false negatives" (how many crimes are committed out of the reach
of public surveillance?) and "false positives" (how many people are falsely
accused based on misuse of the technology?)  If most people don't
commit crimes, then even if you catch *all* of the criminals, your
false positive rate will dominate and you will have a lousy predictive
ability.  Likewise, if you have a high sensitivity to crimes committed
in public, but most crimes are committed out of reach of public surveillance,
you will have poor sensitivity and your false negatives will dominate.

This is where I think the flaw in our public discourse lies.  When
thinking about surveillance, SWAT teams, FAA regulations, DHS
screening, etc., you have to ask yourself what *signal* you're looking
for.  If you're looking for one person in a million (a conservative
estimate for passenger screening!) then you need a really sensitive
filter if you're going to avoid hitting lots of false negatives, and
you're going to have to have a really specific filter if you're going
to avoid inconveniencing innocent people.

And, of course, there's always Bruce Schneier to point out that the
Bad Guys adapt.

The only moderately intriguing (but also chilling) pro-surveillance
argument that I have found is in David Brin's `The Transparent Society
<http://www.amazon.com/Transparent-Society-Technology-Between-Privacy/dp/0738201448>`__,
where he argues that the only way forward is to make the surveillance
cameras publicly accessible.  This would not only prevent crime but
would also prevent police abuses of the technology.

A compelling *counterargument* to this can be found in Vernor Vinge's
book `A Deepness in the Sky
<http://www.amazon.com/Deepness-Sky-Zones-Thought/dp/0812536355>`__.
Vinge makes the essential point that in a transparent society, tyranny
becomes an algorithmic challenge: he who extracts the most information
from the surveillance technologies dominates.  Not reassuring to me,
thank you very much.

p.s. I am increasingly irritated at the adolescent phrasing of the
posts that slashdot approves.  One more reason to go `readdit

   The number of false positives is likely to be low.  Crime is generally
   investigated when a person shows up missing, or someone claims to have
   been the victim of a crime, or possibly when someone notices a crime
   (maybe one where the victim can't speak on their own -- e.g., child
   abuse -- or a victimless crime like drugs).  The point is that it
   happens after the act.    This is very different from detecting
   terrorist attempts, which have to happen before the act.      Also
   including "true negatives" as a number isn't really fair -- it's up
   for dispute if that number means anything at all.  If a picture is
   taken of me, and no one ever sees it, have I lost anything?  Certainly
   not.  If **maybe** someone sees me, have I lost anything?  Possibly;
   it depends on a lot of what I'm doing, and what I think will happen
   because someone sees me.  If **nothing** will happen, then the
   negative effect is rather low -- not tiny, but not bad.  This is the
   nature of public space now; as long as I can find **some** private
   space, the proportion of private to public space is not so terribly
   important.
