I just finished reading `A House in the Sky <http://www.amazon.com/A-House-Sky-Memoir/dp/1451645600>`__, by Amanda Lindhout and
Sara Corbett.  It's an excellent book about Amanda Lindhout's
kidnapping and ransom by Somalian Muslims; it's very well written,
engaging, and utterly terrifying and horrible to read.  Highly
recommended.
