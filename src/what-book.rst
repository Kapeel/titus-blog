The O'Reilly bookstore didn't actually let you buy our `Introduction
to Testing Web Applications with twill and Selenium
<http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/functionalwt/>`__ for the first 24
hours -- some bug on the Web site, apparently...

(See?  That's why you need to buy it!)

p.s. Jason wants to make sure you know that the book doesn't cover Selenium
Remote Control.  Next book, promise.

   Just downloaded a copy!  Congrats.  I LOVE pdf books as you can keep
   them somewhere handy and search them over and over again...
