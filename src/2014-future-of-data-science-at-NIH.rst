In September, I will be visiting the NIH to "chart the next 5 years of
data science at the NIH."  This meeting will use an open space
approach, and we were asked to provide some suggested topics.  Here
are five topics that I suggested, and one that Jeramia Ory suggested
(the last one) in response to `my posting these on Twitter
<https://twitter.com/ctitusbrown/status/486178152545136642>`__.

Additions? Thoughts? Suggestions?

----

1. Education and training in data science: from undergrad through independence

2. Fostering the careers of data scientists in biomedical research

3. Building sustainable cyberinfrastructure to support data intensive research
   in biomedical sciences

4. Supporting and incentivizing a transition to more open science

5. 5 years out: now that we have all the data, what do we do next?

6. How do we support/train curators or a culture of curation? (Good
   curation is a bottleneck to insight.)
