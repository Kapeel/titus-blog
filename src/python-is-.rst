Here at MSU, we just had a 40th anniversary celebration of the Computer
Science department.  As it happens, Carl Page (Sr.) was a founding member of
CSE at MSU, and so his son, Carl Page (Jr.) came and participated in a panel.
In response to my question about what we should be doing in the CS department
to better prepare our students for the future, he commented that our recent
move towards Python was good, and that we should push towards more open-source
involvement as well.  I'm happy with both of those opinions :).

While talking about Python, however, Carl said:

   Python is a scrappy little language that plays well with others.

Well, that, or maybe it was:

   Python is a *crappy* little language that plays well with others.

Hmm, which was it??

   Either way, it plays well with others :-)
