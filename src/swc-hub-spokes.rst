After my recent `next-gen sequencing course
<http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/jun-10/ngs-course-postmortem>`__, which
was supposed to tie into the whole `software carpentry (SWC) effort
<http://software-carpentry.org/>`__ but didn't really succeed in doing
so the first time through, I started thinking about the Right Way to
tie in the SWC material.  In particular, how do you both motivate
scientists to look at the SWC material, and (re)direct people to the
appropriate places?

It's not clear that a Plan is in place.  Greg Wilson seems to assume
that scientists will find at least some of the material immediately
obviously usable, but I think he's targetted at a more sophisticated
population of users -- physicists and the like.  My experience with
bioinformaticians, however, is that they either come from straight
biology backgrounds (with little or no computational background and
rather limited on-the-job training), straight computation backgrounds
(with very little biology), or physics (gonzo programming skills, but
no biology).  The latter fit neatly into the SWC fold, but they (we ;)
are rare in biology.  I think computer scientists and biologists are
going to need guidance to dive into SWC at an early enough time for it
to be the most rewarding.

So, what's a good model for SWC to guide scientists from multiple
disciplines into the appropriate material?  It's obviously not going
to be possible to have Greg et al. tailor the SWC material to individual
subgroups -- he doesn't know much (any ;) biology, for example.  I don't
have the time, patience, or skillset to integrate my next-gen notes
into his SWC material, either.  So, instead, I propose the hub & spokes
model!

Here, the "hub" is the SWC material, and the spokes are all of the
individual disciplines.

Basically, the idea is that individual sites (like my own ANGUS site
on next-gen sequencing, http://ged.msu.edu/angus/) will develop their
own field-specific content, and then link from that content into the
SWC notes.  This way the experts with feet in both fields can link
appropriately, and Greg only has to worry about making the central
content general -- which he's already doing quite well, I think.  Yes,
It's more work than asking Greg to do it, but frankly I'm going to be
happy with a kick-ass central SWC site to which I can link -- right
now it's dismayingly challenging to teach students why this stuff
matters and how to learn it.

From the psychosocial perspective, it's a great fit.  Students can get
hands on tutorials on how to do X, Y, and Z in their own field -- and
then connect into the SWC material to learn the background, or
additional computational techniques in support of it.  Motivation first!

What do we need SWC to do to support this?  Not much -- basically, the
central SWC notes need to be stable enough (with permalinks) that I
can link into them from my own site(s) and not have to worry about the
links becoming broken or (worse) silently migrating in topic.  There
are other solutions (wholesale incorporation of SWC into my own notes,
for example) but I think the permalink idea is the most
straightforward.  Oh, and we should have a Greg-gets-hit-by-a-bus plan,
too; at some point he's going to move on from SWC (perhaps when his
lovely wife decide she's had enough and he needs to stop obsessing over
it, or perhaps under more dire circumstances ;( and it would be good to
know who holds the domain and site keys.

Thoughts?  Comments?

   It seems that the hub &amp; spokes is hardly a proposal since:  - the
   spokes are completely independent, do not need any coordination, and
   do not benefit from any synergy.   - the model calls for Greg to do
   exactly what he has been doing with SWC, except for the part of not
   getting hit by a bus.     Thus the proposal is: you will carry on
   according to your plan, and if anyone else would like to join you, it
   won't change your path a bit.

   JN, yes, exactly.  Well, and he needs to be careful about permalinks,
   too.
