My talk this year kinda sucked -- more on that later -- and I am
trying to come up with good and perhaps even *non-testing* talk ideas
for next year.

One intriguing idea contributed by Brian Dorsey is that of giving 5
lightning talks in a 30 minute session.  Since I like live demos, I could
give five completely different demos, e.g.

 - building and testing CPython across the Snakebite network, 30+ machines

 - Django's test framework, from an outsider/testing-fiend perspective

 - time-series analysis of code coverage data

 - N packages in 5 minutes - trying to easy_install audience-suggested
   packages.

and whatever else comes to mind.  Ideas welcome ;).

I may submit a separate talk proposal on my Web development course, too, but
I have to see how it goes this fall.

   How bout a talk about pony-build? That way you can engage in
   embarrassment driven development ;]

   +1 for Snakebite. I'm eager to find out more.

   +1 for Django test framework.  Not sure if even you have the balls to
   tackle JKM and his drunk Google Alerts for Django  :)

   The multiple lighting talks is an interesting idea.  You may want
   several prepared and either pick depending on what else is being
   covered in the conference or make it audience driven.    +1 snakebite
   talk.  I would humbly suggest that it include a "why this project is
   important" section.  I think there is a contingent that doesn't
   understand.     I would also suggest not talking about yourself in the
   third person. :)

   +1 on the easy_install/N-packages talk as well.    would be good to
   have the commands interactively go to a Windows/OSX/Linux machine
   simultanously and report back the result.  I can help with that :)

   Paul, as you know, the "PyCon Titus" is rather separate from me.

   Don't be so hard on yourself, your talk this year inspired me to start
   using figleaf on a project I'm working on. Huge, complex, written by
   someone else and **zero** tests. Figleaf + Nose has saved the day!
   That said I love the idea for multiple lightning talks with live
   demos.
