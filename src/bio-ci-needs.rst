I recently attended an NSF BIO directorate meeting about
cyberinfrastructure needs.  Here's a list of training & education
challenges identified at that meeting:

  - development and adaptation of tools to archive data and metadata
    from diverse sources to enable data mining

  - integration of structured and unstructured data from heterogenous
    data sources

  - discussion of standard methods for assessing data quality based on
    standard protocols

  - approaches and tools for sharing data within and beyond centers
    prior to publication

  - investigation and understanding of private and public cloud-based
    approaches

  - tools and software for better distributed project participation
    and management

  - visualization approaches
  
  - online/asynchronous training materials
  
  - modeling approaches and practice
  
  - training in open-source-style software development practices
  
  - development of metadata and semantic standards
  
  - information and training on software & data reusability best
    practices, and minimum information standards

  - assessment technologies for how biologists learn computational
    approaches

  - experience in using, adapting, and creating workflows
  
  - development, linkage, and assessment of cross-scale models
  
  - distance teaching approaches and assessment
  
  - approaches to streaming data analysis

What did we miss? ;)
