I'm writing some proposals to expand support for Python infrastructure
(think cross-platform build and test farms a la Snakebite) and for the
Mellon Foundation application, I'd like to find out how Python is
being used in the humanities.  I found NLTK, the Natural Language Toolkit;
what else is big?

thanks,

   Hi,    I guess many projects from the pygame.org and related projects
   would be considered in the humanities and in the arts in general.
   Performance art, visual arts, music, literature, games etc.    Also,
   some OLPC related projects would be considered in the humanities too.
   cu,

   I'm an archaeologist, so sitting somewhere between humanities and
   natural sciences. I've started using Python two years ago and now it's
   the main language I use for writing applications and small utilities
   (almost everything has been released under a free license). Some links
   are at <a

   Most applications are quite technical with respect to archaeology
   itself, but I think a good deal of the whole cultural heritage sector
   is about databases. Python is the upcoming language for a number of
   databases management systems at least in Italy. We had a great
   workshop about archaeology &amp; free/open source software just last
   week, and more than one speaker had been using Python for her/his
   work. <a href="http://www.archeo-foss.org/">http://www.archeo-
   foss.org/</a>    Also, check out the great work done by Sean Gillies
   <a href="http://sgillies.net">http://sgillies.net</a> at the Ancient
   World Mapping Center with Zope for the Pleiades project <a
