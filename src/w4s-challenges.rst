This is one of a bunch of posts on science and the Web.  `Start here
<../w4s-overview.html>`__ for an overview.

The web represents an opportunity for a phase transition in terms of
connectedness and openness in scientific practice, `as in software
development <http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=4564>`__, and we're not taking
much advantage of it.  Why?

1. There is really no direct incentive for many scientists to change.
   (Can we afford to wait for a generation or two for the practice of
   science to change?)

2. Collaboration technology is what's most used by scientists -- e-mail
   and videoconf -- but it's mostly neither open nor hackable.  (Is that
   the future that we want?)

3. Many scientists have virtually no computational literacy.  (Despite
   both the Internet itself and the Web having deep roots in academia,
   most scientists know little outside of their domain, which limits
   their ability to grok the opportunities of new tech.)

4. Lots of new, exciting technology is virtually unusable unless you
   spend a lot of time figuring it out.  (How many of you ever
   set the time on your VCR -- or did I just date myself?)

5. The institutional incentive systems are broken.  (Collaboration is
   either ignored or treated as a negative, while progress is measued
   in dead-tree terms.)

6. Innovation in the social practice of science is tolerated only
   within well-established boundaries.  (Scientists who want to be
   even remotely innovative are discouraged, or, if they're persistent
   enough, treated as outsiders -- because they're stepping outside
   the boundaries of traditional incentive systems.)

7. The funding systems are broken. (Progress is measured in
   in dead-tree terms.)

8. Alternative reputation systems have been slow to emerge.  (What would
   be the point, given the last few things I mentioned?)

9. The traditional incentive systems aren't just slowing down and
   blocking change; they're mutating credit and pushing the right
   people away from science.  (Computational people who are often
   technically integral to projects are regarded as computational
   lackeys, and rarely get those career-important first-author papers;
   instead, their peers and colleagues, who make use of them, garner
   the credit.)

10. There are many individual "points of light", but surprisingly
    little cross-talk, coordination, or advocacy.  (You run into the
    same ol' people again and again, working in their own little
    isolated ponds, precisely *because* the existing system is such an
    overwhelming wet blanket that wider collaborations are an
    unwelcome effort..)

----

In order to accelerate the transition to an open science culture, we
need to figure out how to `meme hack
<http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=4564>`__ science.  This is going to be
tricky -- it requires that new systems be made available that are
*so darned useful* that not using them is unthinkable.

Personal anecdote: my graduate advisor transitioned over to doing his
own e-mail while I was in grad school.  When I first joined the lab,
his admin assistant would bring him printouts of all his e-mails.
Within a few years, he transitioned to reading and answering many of
them personally, to the point where I could reach him more quickly
and easily via e-mail than any other way.

If online webbish science practice really is better, why haven't we
seen scientists switch over en masse to it like we have to e-mail
and online papers?  What's the right hook or set of hooks?  I'd love
to know.
