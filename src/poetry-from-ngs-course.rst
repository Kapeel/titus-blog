an ode to my lab bench...::

   i've returned, my dear friend, after a fortnight away
   delighted to find you, in just the same way
   your tube racks still brilliant in hues of day-glo
   your tip boxes full, vortex ready to go

   please accept my repentance for leaving your side
   but alas it was time to swallow my pride
   to the cloud! for computing i'd hoped to avoid 
   it takes more than bench work to keep me employed 

   a summit of nerds, the timing was right
   to wget some new skills from where ever i might
   the hours were long and the tutorials- hell!
   oh how i longed to run out a gel

   there was trimming and mapping and assembling in haste
   pretending to grasp as i abused copy/paste
   then, as if beckoned, it came unto me-
   man: the savior of every unix newbie

   man curl, man grep, man bamtools, man screed
   my first days at nerd camp were challenging, indeed!
   but suddenly i felt like the boss of the code
   i'd mastered the flags and my for-loops - they flowed

   there were late nights, and errors, and PuTTY!!*&@PuTTYPuTTY%%PuTTY@!PuTTY!$
   but i gunzipped my grit and relied on my buddies
   with guidance and patience and man by my side
   i'd done it: de novo assembly! (but then my laptop died.)

   considering i'd arrived with good humor, at best
   i'd say my endeavors were a tremendous success
   i no longer cry when i see "java -jar"
   but i can't say i'll miss the same...old...salad...bar. (seriously...)

   though i'll never forget this nerdtacular retreat 
   and i'll cherish the nerdmigos that i was lucky to meet
   nothing can top my pipette's perfect fit
   i enjoyed my time in silico but i couldn't git commit
