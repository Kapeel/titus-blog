I'm surprised I haven't seen this on planetpython yet...

   ...an emerging consensus in the scripting community holds that
   **Python is the right solution for freshman programming**.  Ruby would
   also be a defensible choice.

(emphasis mine).  Originally found via `Lambda the Ultimate
<http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/2941>`__, and also passed onto me
by Rich Enbody.

In other news, there are some rumors coming out of the intro CS course
(CSE 231/232) here at Michigan State that the switch to Python from
C++ for the first term, 231, didn't affect the students' performance
in the follow-on course, 232.  That is, students performed equally
well on the 232 final independently of whether or not they'd had
Python or C++ in 231.  I had hoped for an *improvement* in the scores,
but at least it's not a decline!

   Maybe is because students that really care about programming, try
   harder no matter what language is.    I also believe Python is a
   language more suitable for introductory courses of programming,
   specially for non-CS courses. But it happens that students don't care
   about programming in general. One or two years laters they find out
   that the whole course is based on programmin.

   I think intro CS in Python is a great idea as Python looks a lot like
   pseudocode, for example:    &lt;pre&gt;  def foo(x):    if 10 &lt; x
   &lt; 20:    return True    else:    return False  &lt;/pre&gt;
   &gt;&gt;&gt;foo(15)  True  &gt;&gt;&gt;foo(5)  False    I'm at Purdue
   and intro CS is taught entirely in Java like everywhere else....
