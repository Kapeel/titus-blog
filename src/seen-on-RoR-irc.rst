There was another mildly amusing incident during the `recent SoCal
Piggies meeting
<http://agiletesting.blogspot.com/2007/07/your-purpose-is-python-group.html>`__.

Michael Carter was showing us his incredibly neat Web 3.0 / HTTP PUSH
software, `orbited <http://brbx.com/orbited/>`__, by demoing an
interactive IRC client on the Web.  He signed onto the ruby-on-rails
IRC channel and (this being a Python meeting) asked "Is Python better
than Ruby?"

The response, interestingly enough, was (and I paraphrase): "No.  Ruby
is more modern, and because it doesn't use whitespace, you don't have
to use templates."

Well, that didn't make any sense to me, so I asked Michael to follow
up with "what are templates?"

Next response? "In Python/Django, you need to use templates because Python
isn't good for this stuff."

heh.

--titus

p.s. Should I hedge?  Sure.  "No, I don't think every Ruby person is
so silly as to conflate 'Ruby' with 'Ruby on Rails' or 'Python' with
'Django'."

   I think that many of the people who use ruby on rails have a tough
   time differentiating between the language and the framework. I got
   into python via Zope and at first they seemed one and the same to me,
   particularly with Zope's through-the-web scripting stuff. I suppose
   its a common misconception for newcomers to any framework who aren't
   already familiar with the language.

   You also don't have significant whitespace in php, perl or java and
   yet web frameworks with templates exists for those languages.
   Whoever complains about python not being good for the web has to
   explain the popularity of smarty, HTML::Template and velocity.
   Templates are a good idea regardless of the language.     And if you
   complain about such wonders as shrubbery you would complain about
   anything.    Also, significant whitespace is an obstacle to automated
   writting of python, not **from** python.    Could you tell them
   please?
