So, there this guy, Matt Welsh.  And he `left Harvard to go to Google
<http://matt-welsh.blogspot.com/2010/11/why-im-leaving-harvard.html>`__.
OK.

Now he's baaaack, to `point out that academia isn't that rosy
<http://matt-welsh.blogspot.com/2013/04/the-other-side-of-academic-freedom.html>`__.

Yep.  He's not wrong.

A digression
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Were I in a sarcastic mood, I would say something like "ohmigod, Matt
Welsh is pointing out that academia is a social endeavor that is
constrained by funds!!" and proceed to point out that you are,
frankly, rather unworldly if you don't understand that this is true of
just about everything.  In fact, unless you are *not* constrained by
funds (because you are, say, independently wealthy), you should
probably expect to have to engage in convincing other people that you
are doing interesting work and they should fund you, not others.  Cue
politicking.

(Of course, grad students are almost by definition unworldly. But.)

Now, I did spend some time, unsuccessfully, in startupland.  It turns
out that I am uncomfortable bullshitting about commercial viability.
I am far more comfortable in the academic world, where people will
fund me based largely on whether or not I can convince them my work is
*interesting*, not whether it will make money in the real world.  And
I've been more successful as an open source hacker and as a professor
than as an entrepeneur -- remember, kids, if you set the bar low
enough, *even you* can be successful :).

So I think I know a little bit of where Matt Welsh is coming from, and
I will close out this digression by pointing out that someone who has
the skillz to become a tenured faculty member at Harvard is *probably*
going to do well in many intellectual endeavors.  Good for him, but
take his (and my) advice with a grain of salt -- credentials do open
doors, for better or for worse, and advice from a former
tenured prof at Harvard (him) or a Caltech PhD (me) may not translate.
(This is obvious, right?)

On to the advice
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are a gradate student,

and whether or not you are definitely planning to go into academia, or
toying with going into biotech or a startup, or completely uncertain,

**write a professional blog**.

It's `good for research
<http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/literally-psyched/2013/04/12/why-grad-schools-should-require-students-to-blog/?WT.mc_id=SA_sharetool_Twitter>`__,
`good for thinking about stuff
<http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/why-i-blog-2013-version.html>`__, and
leads to `professional advancement
<http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/i-got-tenure-via-klout.html>`__ (that
last one is a joke, ok?)

But seriously, it gives someone something to look at beyond your (no doubt
very limited) CV/resume.

I have recently been engaged in cold-e-mailing industry people on
behalf of friends-with-PhDs (FWPs), and invariably I wish to send out
the blog, Twitter account, and github account for the student in
question.  Only rarely can I do this, because most grad students are
stuck in an academic silo and only poke their head out when they
realize they need to find a job.  By then it's too late.

Or, to put it another way: invariably, the advice I wish I had given
these students two years ago is this: create an online presence for
yourself well before you're looking for a job.

Questions:
~~~~~~~~~~

1. *What should I blog about?*

   Whatever you find interesting.  My blog is mostly professional, with some
   satire and occasional sci-fi/fantasy references.  The point is, it's *me*.

2. *But, what should I say?*

   Something not obviously stupid, racist, or sexist.  (Hopefully this, too
   is obvious, if only in hindsight.)

3. *What if no one reads my blog?*

   That's OK.  It can take a while even if you're saying fantastically
   interesting things.  The important thing is to have some sort of
   online presence showing that you are an awake, interested, and
   occasionally articulate person.

4. *But what if no one likes what I have to say?*

   `What do you care what other people think? <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Do_You_Care_What_Other_People_Think%3F>`__ Seriously, see "articulate, awake" point above.  That's more important than being particularly likable.

5. *What if I suck at blogging?*

   Practice makes better, if not perfect.  Improve thyself.

6. *Could I tweet instead of blog?*

   Absolutely.  The important thing is to get out there.  I think blogs are more permanent, though.

7. *Is it a competitive advantage if everyone is doing it?*

   Good question.  Maybe not, but if you're the only one *not* doing it, then
   it's definitely a *disadvantage*, eh?

8. *Are you, a tenure-track professor at an R1, seriously telling my students
   to waste their time on blogging instead of generating first-author pubs
   for themselves?*

   Yep.  Dear professor, at this point you need to look at yourself in the
   mirror and admit that there is more to life than a tenure track career,
   and moreover that you cannot guarantee your graduate students such a
   career.  It would be a good idea to start helping them prepare for something
   else.

   Besides, you can put their blogs down as evidence of your outreach component
   for your NSF grants.  Yes, this works.

9. *Why should I listen to you?  You're not at Harvard!*

   Neither is Matt Welsh.

Concluding thoughts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

My advice really boils down to one thing: build your online presence
so that you can point prospective employers at it.  This will help
when employers want to know something about you; I think you'd be
surprised at how difficult it is to tell good applicants from bad
applicants via only a CV or interview, so every bit helps.

(Also, if you're a programmer, I'd strongly suggest working on open
source projects in your spare time.  But not everyone's a programmer.)
