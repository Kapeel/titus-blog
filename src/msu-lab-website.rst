I've just put up a simple lab Web site for my future lab at Michigan
State U.; I'm calling it the `Lab of Genomics, Evolution, and
Development <http://ged.cse.msu.edu>`__.

   Really cool Titus!  The science you are doing is very interesting ...
   hmmm, maybe I should have gotten into Biology.  =o)    Question:
   "intertwingle" - is that a word?  A variation of intertwine maybe ...
   =o)  Although, I have seen it used by some CS people.  I like it
   though, Merriam-Webster should make that a new word in their
   dictionary.

   Thanks, Melissa!  It's the science I **hope** to do, really, although
   I guess I have been doing some of it...    For intertwingle, see:
