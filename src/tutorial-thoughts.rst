Steve Holden and Doug Napoleone both attended our `testing tutorial
<http://us.pycon.org/2008/tutorials/AgileWebTesing/>`__, (as did AMK,
which was a bit of a surprise!), and had `fairly
<http://holdenweb.blogspot.com/2008/03/practical-applications-of-agile-web.html>`__
`positive <http://www.dougma.com/archives/67>`__ things to say about
it.  This was a relief, because Grig and I always wonder whether or not
this stuff is useful to anyone.

Our hope for this year was to stir things up by making the tutorial
more interactive.  We succeeded to the extent that there were a few
more questions and a bit more interaction, but we would have liked to
get more in the way of pre-tutorial feedback.  In retrospect, the
tutorial might have worked better if two things had happened:

 1. People signing up for the tutorial had actually sent us a bunch of
    things to test.  As it was, we got about 5 e-mails, which didn't
    give us a lot of problem choices; some of the suggested problems
    were out of scope or too big to tackle in the time we had.

    This is not really anyone's fault, although probably Grig and I could
    have done more in advance.

 2. Grig and I had had more time to prepare.

    Both of us are crazy busy (he has a job that is a big timesuck,
    and I am in the middle of a transition from postdoc to prof, which
    means that I'm trying to finish some research while setting up a
    new lab 2000 miles away, PLUS I have a wonderful new daughter who
    is also quite the timesuck.

Now, don't get me wrong -- we did prepare adequately, but I would have
liked a week or so to actually do some Really Cool New Stuff.

I'm not sure what to do next year, if anything.  This was our third
tutorial, and people seem to attend them and like them, but I feel
like we should try something different.  Unfortunately, the lack of
reliable network access really limits our ability to push forward into
doing live tutorials and code writing; Web testing depends on the Web!

Regardless of our thoughts, I am interested in any suggestions that people
may have.  If you've attended our tutorial -- what would you have liked
to see, OR now that you've seen it once, what would you want to see the
second time around, if anything?  If you haven't attended our tutorial,
what would you imagine to be the most interesting "testing tutorial"
possible?

thanks,
--titus

   Titus,    Would it be possible for you to make your slides and/or
   other tutorial materials available online (for those who did not
   attend)?  (I'm not being a cheapskate--I attended three other
   tutorials and it was a difficult decision for me to not attend yours.
   Perhaps next year.)  I'll do my best to give you some useful feedback.

   @Titus: as a newbie at the tutorial I found you r material really
   interestting (though I let it get away from me when I left the room to
   get water). I think if the growth we saw this year continues then we
   will have to ensure that such material doesn't get thrown away.    How
   about two tutorials next year, one a the "same old, same old" for
   people who need to understand the technologies and the second a more
   advanced one?    @Daryl: I believe all tutorials were recorded, and
   the the slides will be published fairly soon.

   Hi Titus,    I attended your tutorial, and quite frankly I do not
   think you need to change anything. You talk was interesting, engaging
   and very inspiring (and now that I've finished an sqlite backend for
   the project I am working on, the testing setup should be considerably
   easier). Mind you, that's coming from someone who was jetlagged and
   had two tutorial sessions before showing up at yours :)    The web
   traffic recording/replay demo was awesome. Simple, useful and very
   very cool. As was your OLPC presentation (attended that one too after
   the tutorial), where you could not log in with the keyboard, but
   could, in fact, with your test harness. Testing -- now **easier** than
   doing it by hand :)    A possible suggestion to consider for next
   year: write a really small project and walk through setting up testing
   for it (first something simple, like nosetests/py.test, then the web
   coverage example you had on the OLPC talk). I am not sure what could
   fit within a tutorial session, but something small, self-contained and
   obvious?     Thank you for your contribution to PyCon. It was very
   interesting.

   Titus,      I'm going to echo Steve's comment - I think there will
   likely be those who are new to automated testing that will be able to
   get benefit from your existing presentation next year, and the year
   after, and the year after...      There were more than 400 people
   attending their first PyCon this year - with 50 people / tutorial,
   you've got at least 8 years worth of students yet! &lt;g&gt;    Ken
