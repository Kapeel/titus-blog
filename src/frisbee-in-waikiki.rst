I don't suppose anyone knows of a low- or medium-intensity pickup frisbee
game somewhere within walking distance of Waikiki...?

If so, `drop me a note <mailto:titus@idyll.org>`__ -- thanks!

   E-mail Larry O'brien and ask him, his email's on the front page of <a
   href="http://knowing.net">http://knowing.net</a> .    What a weird
   world where I happen to know a software developing frisbee player that
   lives on Hawaii.
