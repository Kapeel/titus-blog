The blognet is full of people posting their own opinions, and that's a
good thing.  What is a little less supportable is flawed argumentation.

I recently spent some time discussion a post about software
engineering; I was trying to figure out why the author thought what he
did.  The annoying bit was that his arguments boiled down to "I'm
right because I say I am, and you can't disagree because it's a matter
of logic: I'm starting from the axiom that A is true, and since my
conclusion (A is true!)  follows from that axiom, there is no argument
possible."  That is true as long as you acknowledge his starting
axiom, but of course interesting discussions don't ever follow from
this style of argument.

I see three categories of argumentation.

First, math-logic, in which the axioms and ground truths are given,
and the rules of logic are applied to reach some conclusion.
Conclusions are interesting only when a non-trivial result is reached:
`Euclidian Geometry
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry#Axiomatic_approach>`__
is an excellent example, where 5 postulates lead to a plethora of
interesting results.  The drawback is that math-logic is very rarely
directly applicable to reality: why (for example) `Hilbert spaces
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space>`__ apply directly to
physical processes, and how far we can take this kind of
correspondence between formal math and messy physics, is a fascinating
and open topic of discussion.

The second type of argument is scientific, in which falsifiable
statements are made about the real world.  The distinction here is
that a scientific theory must make predictions, and if those
predictions are found to be false, then the theory itself must be
false as it stands.  Again, conclusions here are only interesting when
the predictions are non-trivial with respect to the starting point:
Quantum Mechanics and the `Standard Model
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model>`__ are both good
examples, because (even though they *must* be wrong in certain
regimes) they both make a large number of testable predictions.
Evolution is a bit more controversial, scientifically speaking,
because the predictions it makes have more wiggle room: however,
specific predictions about how protein sequences should behave have
been made and verified.

Third, rhetorical (using rhetoric in the sense of "verbal
communication; discourse").  In rhetorical arguments, people start
from positions that may or may not be well defined, but in any case
are open to disagreement; participants are seeking to convince other
participants as well to explore their own arguments.  When Paul Graham
writes about how `Essays <http://www.paulgraham.com/essay.html>`__
help him reach "surprises", he is talking about the most interesting
kind of rhetorical argument: one that helps you realize truths that
flow naturally from your internal precepts, modified by opinions and
facts from the real world.

Rhetorical arguments are by far the most common on the Internet, and
people often try to masquerade them as math-logic or scientific
arguments.  This is because math-logic and scientific arguments are
both much stronger kinds of arguments; they lead to some notion of
"truth", in either logic-space or reality-space.  By contrast,
rhetorical arguments are much less well-defined in both their starting
and ending points, and (when two stubborn people conduct them) usually
end in one or both people simply leaving the discussion.  This is
especially true when either of the participants refuses to discuss the
precepts leading to the discussion: after all, if you're not starting
from the same assumed ground truth, then the discussion can only
rarely conclude with agreement; the main point of the discussion
should then become to figure out where you differ in your assumptions.

Getting back to the frustrating blog post interaction that led to my
post, then, the author started by asserting a moderately strong
statement, and then defended himself against all comers by stating
that "it was simply a matter of logic".  This was undoubtedly true:
asserting fact A and then concluding fact A is, in fact, a matter of
logic.  However, it is not interesting.

After probing a bit, I figured out that:

 - the author's argument, stripped of language, really did boil down to an
   assertion followed by a conclusion based *immediately* on that
   assertion.

 - the author explicitly rejected the notion that their conclusion could
   be falsified in any way.

Thus the argument was not an interesting math-logic argument (because the
conclusions followed immediately from the precepts) and it was not a
scientific argument (because the conclusions were not falsifiable).
The only potentially interesting part of the argument was rhetorical --
and the author also explicitly rejected discussion of his initial axiom,
rendering that uninteresting.

I probably wouldn't have gotten irritated, either, if the author
hadn't decided that my comments, still polite and on-topic, weren't
worth posting any more.  Since they continued posting the sycophantic
"what a good idea! <gush>" comments, I concluded that the whole point
of the post was simply to garner attention.  Disappointing ;(.

Math-logic: when interesting conclusions follow immediately from assumptions,
that tells you that the assumptions contained that of interest; turns into
a rhetorical argument about the assumptions.
