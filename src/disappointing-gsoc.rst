A disappointing SoC experience

I was the official mentor for a Google Summer of Code student this
year -- Martin van Loewis was "technical mentor" -- and I found it to
be a disappointing experience.  At the beginning, I felt guilty about
not being more on the ball about pushing the student to do more work;
by the end, it became clear that whatever the student's original
intentions had been, this project was certainly not their priority.

Next time, I will inform the student(s) of my expectations upfront;
insist on weekly status reports, however short; expect to see working,
tested code checked in to a public repository; and, if these
expectations are not met, the student will not be paid for the first
half of the summer.  (If they *are* met, the student can expect (at
the minimum) positive recommendation letters from me, on top of the
salary.)

More generally, I would suggest that people not take GSoC students
with whom they have had no prior contact, unless those students are
local and can be pressured with direct social interaction ;).  Oh,
that, and don't accept proposals that are inaccurate with respect to
technical details: the odds are against those people actually
*learning* the technical stuff.

I don't regret signing up for this -- it was a learning experience -- but
I regret that the opportunity was wasted, for the PSF, for Google, and
for the student.

   You'll soon be advising people and acting as a committee member on
   doctoral dissertations and masters theses.  Better to have this
   experience first on a 3 month project than on a 24 or 48 month one.
   That's the learning experience silver lining you mentioned.  Thanks
   for your continued interest in and contributions to the Python
   community.

   Sorry it wasn't a more positive experience for you --- I've now been
   sole mentor on four, and co-mentor on two, and they've all been very
   rewarding.  Better luck next time...

   As an ex-GSoC student (2005) I can entirely agree with explaining your
   expectations up front, they are so reasonable that I'd almost say
   essential (and it's sad you have to mention them explicitly).  But I
   must disagree with your suggestion to not accept students unless you
   don't know the first.  One point (IMHO) of the SoC is to lower the bar
   for new people.  You should be more strict on the technical proposal
   if you want to be more strict (which is reasonable, you don't want to
   be wasting your time).    Lastly I'd say mentors should also have an
   obligation of providing feedback every $weeks and run the code.  ;-)

   I had a similar experience in 2005, or maybe worse... I had a student
   who wrote a promising proposal, then after the initial contact I
   didn't hear from him at all anymore. Fortunately I had a second
   student who did put in the work.
