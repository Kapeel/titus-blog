Over the last few weeks, I've been on a bit of a `Cory Doctorow
<http://craphound.com/>`__ kick.  I started by reading `Homeland
<http://craphound.com/homeland/>`__, a sequel to the excellent `Little
Brother <http://craphound.com/littlebrother/>`__; these two **very
important** books about anti-terror-enabled government suppression of
liberty and free speech are very well written and extremely timely.  I
then moved on to `For the Win <http://craphound.com/ftw/>`__, a
somewhat more mediocre book about unionizing and gold farming; and I
just finished `Makers <http://craphound.com/makers/>`__, a truly
visionary if somewhat halting story about people who Make Stuff, and
their battles with more traditional corporations.

(All of these books are freely available for e-book download, and are
also available off of Amazon.  I would start with `Little Brother
<http://craphound.com/littlebrother/>`__ as it is very approachable,
well written, and all too realistic.)

Whence the title of this post?

I was reading `Makers <http://craphound.com/makers/>`__ while I was at
the workshop on `Cyberinfrastructure for Marine 'Omics
<http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2013-gbmf-mmi.html>`__, and it took me a
few days to realize that my mental landscape had been seriously warped
by Makers (in a good way)! I think much of my grumpiness about our
current models of software development and funding came from the
juxtaposition of the very bottom-up, creativity driven,
many-resources-are -essentially-free world of Makers -- which works --
and the traditional academic approach of Big Software Projects -- for
which there is strong evidence that it does not work that well.  Whoa,
*major* cognitive dissonance: here I am, an increasingly card-carrying
member of the Big Projects club, reading a very plausible book about
how I am a dinosaur.

That recognition is one strong motivation for the post `Crowdsourced
-omic analysis
<http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/crowdsourced-analysis-with-data-privacy-sunset.html>`__.
Even if the first 10 versions of the pipeline kinda suck, incremental
improvements via a true, forkable open source development model
virtually *guarantee* that at some point it will stop sucking.  If,
as I am hoping to do with khmer, we can bring the compute costs closer
to zero, we will have eliminated the only major barrier other than
creativity and good science.  Worth a shot, eh?

Anyway, just thought I'd share.
