How should I recruit grad students to MSU CSE?

So, next May I'm starting as an `assistant professor
<http://ged.cse.msu.edu/>`__ split between the `Computer Science
<http://www.cse.msu.edu>`__ and `Microbiology and Molecular Genetics
<http://www.mmg.msu.edu>`__ departments at `Michigan State
U. <http://www.msu.edu>`__, and I'm interested in attracting as many
good CS **grad** applicants as I can from the open source and
bioinformatics communities.  (I would also like to attract an
experimental student or two, but blogging is probably not the right
venue for that..)

I have some thoughts on how to do that, but I'd be interested in
finding out what you all would be interested in hearing about.  What
sorts of things would make you forward on an advert to smart, young,
academically-inclined college students?  I'm not talking gimmicks here,
but rather straightforward infodumps.

For example, I can confidently say that if you want to work on
*digital life*, there is no better place in the world to apply: both
Charles Ofria and Rich Lenski are at MSU (see `the Devolab
<http://devolab.cse.msu.edu/>`__).

I hope that the same will be true for several of my interest areas,
like metagenomics and regulatory genomics. In metagenomics and
microbial ecology and metagenomics, for example, you cannot hope for
better experimentalists (Jim Tiedge and Tom Schmidt, not to mention
several younger faculty).  There is a `Quant Bio initiative
<http://biomodel.msu.edu>`__ that includes bioinformatics and systems
biology.  The new `Gene Expression in Disease and Development
<http://www.bmb.msu.edu/GEDD/index.html>`__ initiative includes some
very good people (Dave Arnosti and Lee Kroos, among others) working on
regulatory genomics.  I'm involved in all of these programs and
initiatives, and (to be horribly immodest) I know the biology and the
bioinformatics both, which makes me an excellent resource even if you're
not working directly with me.

I've also gotten some interest in the idea of setting up a course of
study on computational science, too -- think Software Carpentry --
that will probably end up being an adjunct to whatever students are
actually working on -- bioinformatics, physics, CS, etc.  The work
remains to be done, but it's a clear necessity.

The real attraction to the kind of community I can reach with this
blog, though, is that I'm going to lobby hard to get open source
technologies and thought patterns introduced into the CS curriculum.
"We" (by which I mean Rich Enbody and Bill Punch) have already
switched one of the intro courses on programming over to Python, and I
will be teaching an Intro to Web Dev course a year from now --
test-driven Web development with AJAX, Python/Quixote, and PostgreSQL.
(Yes, it will be taught at both the practical and theoretical levels,
don't worry; I intend to make it perfectly useless to both job seekers
and academicians.)

I think there are tons of opportunities to introduce more open source
stuff into the curriculum, and I'm not alone in the department -- I'm
just the person most involved in OSS development, and hence the person
most likely to do something about it ;).  However, to do so, I will
need to find students who can TA those classes, not to mention help
convincing other faculty members that this is a good way to go.

So: digital life; cutting edge biology and bioinformatics;
computational science; and/or open source.  What's not to like?

Anyway, all this goes to say that if you know people who are
interested in any of the above, please point them my way.

In particular, if you are an undergraduate with open-source
programming experience (i.e. you have the code to show, and maybe a
blog with technical musings) and you want a CS masters or PhD, apply
and I'll do my best to get you through the admissions committee --
even if you don't want to work with me ;).

And if you want to hear more about the department, or think I should talk
more about the grad program, please ask me questions.  I have to confess
to being new to the department, 

cheers,
