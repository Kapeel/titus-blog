Some interesting posts over in Planet Perl:

 - `Perl 5 is Dying <http://use.perl.org/~Ovid/journal/38010>`__
 - `So What (are you going to do about it)? <http://use.perl.org/~chromatic/journal/38016?from=rss>`__
 - `Perl 5 Programmers are Dying <http://use.perl.org/~Ovid/journal/38018?from=rss>`__

While I'm a raging Python fanatic (or at least a serious Python user
:) I don't think this is anything to gloat about: Perl vs Python
is a relatively minor struggle compared to Good Language vs PHP, and
Dynamic vs Static.

Either way there are good lessons for any language in there.  And we
should be sure to thank GvR, Barry Warsaw, and all the other Py3k
contributors for moving forward with Py3k... Say what you will about
Py3K's backwards incompatibility, but I think the lack of a strongly
determined future for Perl, i.e. a clear roadmap for Perl 6, is one of
the Perl community's big problems.

   But the fact remains that both python and ruby appeal to new users
   more readily than perl's syntax will.    Perl 5 stopped evolving. it
   still has a huge niche, an ecosystem of C coders who are 60 years or
   older ;-)    But the new blood isnt coming into Perl. The fossil
   coders repeat how great CPAN is but they forget that perl as a
   language is not as good as ruby and python.

   Agreed. While I do have things to say about Python 3's lack of
   backwards compatibility, the core developers have managed the
   situation a whole lot better than the Perl 6 project did. The Python
   core developers value the evolutionary approach, and don't tend to get
   carried away by ambitious projects like a massive revision of the
   language **and** interpreter infrastructure (Parrot).     The Python
   developers reach for the possible and leave the insanely ambitious and
   difficult to other projects like PyPy. That's the right way to go
   about it.

   Wishful thinking much ?    If Perl 5 stopped evolving why has 5.10 got
   new operators and features, as well as bein faster ?    I don't think
   there is much evidence that the Python core developers have managed
   anything better at all.. both Parrot/Perl6 and Python 3000 projects
   were started about the same time, and Parrot 1.0 will be delivered in
   March, while Perl 6.0 will be delivered the following January, so it's
   a matter of a few months difference, despite Pythons huge hyperbole
   and Google backing.    We've had 5.8 and 5.10 versions of Perl
   released since Perl 6 was started, and will likely have a 5.12, and
   many features of Perl 6 have already been included in 5.10 or made
   available through CPAN.    Anyway.. much as some Pythonista might
   hope, the constant repitition of the PiD meme does you no favours and
   just gets in the way of mixing communities.    I'd love to start a
   Dynamic Languages user group in my area, but I can't be bothered with
   all the Python Zealots. The PHP, Lua and Ruby guys may have drunk the
   koolaid but at least you can talk with them.

   Perl 5 didn't stop evolving: there is perl 5.10 with serious changes
   (including features from Perl 6), Moose and MooseX::Declare that are
   more serious OO system that Perl's integrated (that was copied from
   Python). And many, many others. Perl programming evolved much in
   latest 2 years.    I read someone's blog a year ago that was bashing
   Perl based on 10 year old description of Perl. Many programmers
   (especially python ones :)) don't know about changes in latest 8 years
   and do similar things.    I general, problem is very huge base of
   programs that should work on future versions of Perl. So removing
   features in Perl 5 is not good.    As chromatic said, Python 3000 was
   developed more that 9 years, so 8 years of Perl 6 is not much.

   I wouldn't underestimate the Perl community.  Sure, they're taking
   their time with Perl 6 and Parrot, but... would we want either of them
   rushed?  I didn't understand Parrot until listening to developer
   presentations at OSCON and elsewhere.  Imagine a better .NET, and open
   source.    And no, none of the Perl 6 and Parrot crew appear advanced
   in years, as if such blatant agism would be an appropriate criticism
   in any event.  These are youthful C coders at the top of their games,
   with the courage to think about problems other language developers are
   all too pleased to avoid.    I'm sticking with these folks, and
   sticking with Perl.  This language still has a lot of visionaries on
   the team, and a lot of legs.

   I wish people that mention Perl 6 actually knew what they were talking
   about. The only thing Perl 6 has done "wrong" is marketing. Perl 6 is
   a total re-write of the Perl language and yes it has taken a long
   while for the volunteers to put together. On the other hand, you have
   Python 3 which is not a total re-write at all and was at least
   backhandedly funded by the Google machine. I like both languages
   actually but your (Martijn) opinion about "the right was to go about
   it" is just that, your opinion.

   I'm not sure I'm that sorry to see Perl fade away. On various
   occasions I've experienced cheap shots, sniping and puerile remarks
   about Python from Perl programmers, who would rather see everyone
   waste their time fiddling with Perl, and I've encountered more than
   enough decaying Perl code over the years, probably as a consequence of
   this shoehorning tendency.    The Ruby people managed quite a "bait
   and switch" routine with those Perl people dissatisfied with the state
   of Perl but too proud to switch to Python. Now, a lot of those people
   are using a language which is much closer to Python, and which has
   dropped a lot of the Perl-style compatibility baggage: they can surely
   keep up their whining about Python from another location, oblivious to
   the inherent contradiction in their position.    Still, there's a
   lesson to the Python community here as well. Perl still gets a lot of
   usage because of all the libraries, even though I suspect that many of
   them are overrated (the "CPAN is wonderful" argument). In contrast,
   Python's standard library decays and the Python 3000 tidying project
   has taken precedence.    Changing these priorities in order to confirm
   Python as a better choice than the "incumbent" (Perl and Java,
   frequently) is better than looking over one's shoulder at whatever the
   next supposedly cool language is doing; this means improving the
   library offerings and making the details of actual work, not language
   gymnastics, easier.
