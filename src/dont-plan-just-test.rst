Recently seen on a list (with a nasty archival system that I don't
want to link to): ::

    "Don't write a test plan. Instead, test."

		 -- Bret Pettichord

Need I say more?

Probably.

One of the most important tenets of agility (<-- little 'a' ;), in my
opinion, is to not *overthink*.  Unless you're an exceptional,
intelligent, and experienced person -- or else just plain lucky --
you're unlikely to presage the specific problems you're going to
encounter in a new project.  This is just as true of testing as it is
of software development.

So my advice is:

Prototype, don't design.

Test, don't plan.

(...in the usual sense: "the actions on the left are likely to be of
more value than the actions on the right.  don't dogmatise me
unnecessarily!)

   I personally like that style as that is how I do things...I would
   rather prototype and learn interactively.  I am probably not smart
   enough to think the problem entirely through in my head...then you add
   threads and forget it :)
