a.k.a. "why we should care:"

From the Comp Sci dept WIMS mentor:

   * "In terms of design teams and designing products, there's evidence
     from other industries that if you have just a male team, you could
     have a flawed product. Let's look at air bags, for example. Only 8
     percent of mechanical engineers are female, and most of the teams
     working on air bags were predominantly male. When air bags were
     invented based on the male body as the norm, they ended up being
     potentially deadly to women and children. That's also happened
     with heart valves and voice-recognition systems; they were geared
     toward the male." (J. Margolis, in an interview at
     http://news.cnet.com/2008-1082-833090.html)  Of course, a similar
     concern holds for teams with no minority representation.

   * Is there something in the genetic makeup of women and minorities
     that explains the lack of interest?  Not likely.  This was the
     argument that used to be made for why so few chose science,
     medicine, law, etc. decades ago.  But these fields have made an
     effort to address some of the barriers to women and minorities
     and, as a result, their percentages have increased.

Separately, from Gizmodo via the Interesting People mailing list: ::

  This is awkward. It appears that HP's new webcams, which have facial-      
  tracking software, can't recognize black faces, as evidenced in the
  above video. HP has responded:

  We are working with our partners to learn more. The technology we
  use is built on standard algorithms that measure the difference in
  intensity of contrast between the eyes and the upper cheek and nose. We       
  believe that the camera might have difficulty "seeing" contrast in
  conditions where there is insufficient foreground lighting.

What would you want to bet that that development team had only white
people on it?

   J. Margolis in an interview claims that air bags were "invented based
   on the male body as the norm"? ROFL.    The idea that mechanical
   engineers (regardless of sex) in the automotive field would design (a
   better word than invent) a high-consequence device for universal
   application without a comprehensive risk assessment is ludicrous.
   The design criteria for air bags won't involve norms -- but extremes.
   Too heavy or large a person and the bag's expansion may not be
   forceful enough or cover enough area to prevent death or injury
   resulting from the accident. Too light or small a person and the bag's
   expansion itself will do more damage than the accident would have. The
   compromise rests on a risk assessment. Evidently, J. Margolis thinks
   that this assessment's outcome **must** be influenced by the sex of
   the analyst and peers.    Browse About.com's pediatrics section and
   you will find: "An inflating passenger air bag can kill a baby in a
   rear-facing safety seat. An air bag also can be hazardous for children
   age 12 and under who ride facing forward. This is especially true if
   they are not properly buckled up in a safety seat, booster seat, or
   lap and shoulder belt."     This sad fact is the result of a
   compromise based on risk assessment. The J. Margolis' solution is to
   have mechanical engineers who are children. ROFL.

   Or, perhaps, the women engineers might have assessed the risks
   differently...

   Hi Titus,    Perhaps I was not clear. Air bags were NOT "invented
   based on the male body as the norm." Period. (I point out why it is
   ludicrous to even think they were.) So the entire line of reasoning is
   based on an example that is false.    So I would also hope that "women
   engineers might have assessed the risks differently." The male
   certainly engineers did.    But if this example is flawed, can better
   examples be found for endorsing "gender-diverse" engineering? Sure.
   But only when we keep firmly in mind that engineering is partly art
   and partly science. To say the art part of engineering is affected by
   gender is one thing. But to say the scientific part is also affected
   is quite another.    IMHO, the art part of engineering (creativity,
   architecture, management, computer programming, etc.) does suffer from
   a lack of cultural and gender diversity. However, the scientific part
   (math, physics, chemistry, computer algorithms, etc.) does not. (In
   fact, it MUST not. Otherwise, science loses its objectivity.)
   Therefore, I think I could show examples where risk management
   benefits from diversity. However, diversity itself neither benefits
   nor harms risk assessments.    George
