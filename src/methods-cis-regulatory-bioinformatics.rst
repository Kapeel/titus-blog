I just finished a chapter for a book, *Methods in Avian Embryology*,
being edited by my boss, Marianne Bronner-Fraser.  This chapter is
intended for developmental biologists who are interested in locating
regulatory modules and analyzing them for binding sites.  It ended up
being my outlet for a compilation of problems and drawbacks to
computational search, and so it might be useful to non-biologists,
too.  I'd be happy to pass a copy on to people who are interested;
