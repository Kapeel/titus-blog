Testing out Remote Learning Sites
---------------------------------
Continuing our efforts to bring bioinformatics training to a wider audience 
while maintaining small class sizes, we are trying something new!  Emily 
Dolson will be teaching a half day d3.js lesson to a class at Michigan 
State University, and we will be broadcasting it to three remote classrooms 
(UC Davis, University of Florida, and Virginia Tech) using Google Hangouts 
on Air.  Each location will host a room of about 35 students with helpers
and a room leader.  The role of the helpers will be the usual assistance 
with questions or computer problems, and the room leader is responsible for 
making sure that questions are asked when they come up.  An added bonus of
using Google Hangouts on Air is that we are able to livestream the lesson
to YouTube.


Why learn d3.js?
----------------
Want to make pretty, dynamic, and interactive data visualizations like 
http://charts.animateddata.co.uk/ukwind/ and
http://mbostock.github.io/d3/talk/20111116/iris-splom.html? D3 (which 
stands for Data Driven Documents) is a Javascript library that enables you 
to display data in a flexible way. Since it's a Javascript library, these 
visualizations can easily be shared either offline or via the internet. The 
option to add interactive elements to your visualization lends itself to 
making your data easy for others to explore. We'll be running a 3-hour 
workshop covering the basics of using d3.js to visualize data. No prior 
web programming experience required (we'll teach you the necessary Javascript 
and html), but this workshop is aimed at people who already feel comfortable 
programming in at least one language.
