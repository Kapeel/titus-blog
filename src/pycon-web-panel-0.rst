I'll edit http://us.pycon.org/TX2007/WebFrameworksPanel as I update things,
but here's the proposal I submitted:

Frameworks:
 * Zope (?)
 * CherryPy (Robert Brewer)
 * TurboGears (Kevin Dangoor?)
 * Django (Adrian Holovarty?)
 * Pylons (Ben Bangert?
 * Quixote (Neil?)
 * Twisted web (?)
 * web.py (Aaron Swartz?)

2 minute presentation by each representative, introducing:
 * point of framework;
 * short example
 * guess at user base
 * size of developer community

Followup questions:

 * When did the framework come into existence and what problem was it
   created to solve?
 * Why did the frameworks that existed at the time not meet your particular
   needs?
 * What are its strengths and maturity level? What is it ideal to use for?
 * What wouldn't you use it for?  why not?
 * What frameworks are related?
 * What are your future directions?
 * How do you feel about WSGI, and what benefits (if any) do you think
   it brings?
 * Do you use an O/R mapping (SQLObject/SQLAlchemy), and if so, what
   benefits do you think it gives you?  Any negatives?
 * What template language(s) do you favor/support?
 * How well do you support AJAX?
 * What sort of testing infrastructure do you use/support?

I'll have a chat server or a Web site where people can ask followup
questions, if the Internet connectivity is sufficient (it wasn't, last
year!)  Otherwise, I'll open the floor up to questions towards the
end.
