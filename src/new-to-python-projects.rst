Hi all,

I need to find some useful projects for new, young contributors,
especially in the area of 3rd party packages; we've been thinking
about things like porting 3rd party packages to Py3K, adding tests to
existing projects, and providing Windows binary eggs for various
packages.  Everything would be open source, contributed back to the
projects, etc., of course.

We're mainly looking for fairly small individual projects: nothing
terribly big or complicated.

Please dump brain => comments section, or just `e-mail me directly
<mailto:titus@idyll.org>`__.

thanks,
--titus

   I hope you collect some good ideas. I am sure there are plenty of
   people of all levels of coding that would like a good starting point
   to get involved in the community, learn new skills, and get involved
   with open source software in general.     I hope so anyway. I look
   forward to seeing the suggestions.

   I'm interested in the submissions. How many have you received to date?
   Care to publish a sample?

   What about <a href="http://nltk.sourceforge.net/">NLTK</a>? Be quite
   fun if you're interested in languages, and there's many possible
   threads that could be picked up and worked on fairly discretely.

   John: I've received zero, apart from the NLTK suggestion.  For which I
   give thanks to pfctdayelise ;)    See    <a

   stdlib.html">http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/nov-07/hidden-gems-in-
   stdlib.html</a>    for a (very successful!) alternate tack that I took
   ;)    And watch this space for announcements...    --titus

   Um reinteract is a cool and new python project. It is a whole new app
   in Python but it also needs supporting modules.    <a href="http://fis

   (I work for a non-profit that does patent work in the developing
   world.)  I'd love to see the following:    - simple py app (web or
   gui) to access EPO's Open Patent Services: <a
   href="http://ops.espacenet.com/">http://ops.espacenet.com/</a>    -
   ditto for NCBI/PUBMED's eutils: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/e
   ntrez/query/static/eutils_help.html">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entre
   z/query/static/eutils_help.html</a>    - django
   (http://www.djangoproject.com/) app for tracking/researching patents
   Also, as a student of Chinese:    - web app that keeps track of your
   vocabulary in a new language and presents you with daily news stories
   that contain X% words you know, with definitions for others sucked
   from StarDict dictionaries.    Others:    - Gui wrapper around
   libgmail (http://libgmail.sourceforge.net/) for sending email with
   variable substitution, e.g. "Hi $(NAME) , great to see you $(TIME)."

   Hey Titus, a few ideas for ya:    -PyPy, they always need people to
   test, write tests, debug code.    -Contact the devs of Django and
   CherryPy, see if they need any help.    -Or take a look at the vaults
   of parnassus for any interesting projects that may need help, testing,
   whatever: <a href="http://py.vaults.ca/apyllo.py/">http://py.vaults.ca
   /apyllo.py/</a>    This is a cool thing you're doing. :D

   I am looking for a few people to join me on the dbsprockets project.
   dbsprockets is a system designed to integrate SQLAlchemy and
   Toscawidgets, making it easier for developers to create forms on a
   Pylons or TG web application.  Most of the low-level design is in
   place, I am working on flushing things out a bit.  I could use someone
   who is proficient in JS and CSS and would like to learn more about the
   guts of Pylons and/or TG and is willing to do TDD.  This is a short
   term project expected to be finished by the end of the pycon sprints.
   Thanks for the call out Titus.  -chris

   A bit esoteric, but a way of incorporating geostats and 3d
   interpolation (kriging) into scientific python - this comes up about
   once every 4 months or so as a topic on the SciPy list.  The responses
   mostly suggest wrapping an existing library.

   <a href="http://python.eventscripts.com">http://python.eventscripts.co
   m</a>    We could use some help writing game addons and core libraries
   for Counter-Strike: Source, Half-Life 2 and the like. It's really more
   of a community effort to enhance the game and publish addons on <a hre
   f="http://addons.eventscripts.com">http://addons.eventscripts.com</a>
   .    Still, a huge number of teens and young adults are getting their
   first scripting experiences working on  their own addons and libraries
   for others to use.    The Python engine for CS:S just went live, so
   we're enjoying the excitement there.

   Python is one of the main languages for the <a
   href="http://www.olpc.com/">One Laptop Per Child</a> computer. Do
   something for it, and you'll affect millions of kids (and adults)
   world-wide. Give One, Get One - act before Nov 26th.
