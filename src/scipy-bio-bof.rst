Chris Lee and I would like to set up a Birds-of-a-Feather gathering at
`SciPy '07 <http://www.scipy.org/SciPy2007/>`__.  We'll probably have an
initial meeting on Thursday, August 16th, and then maybe work into 
sprint mode for that Saturday.

`Contact me <mailto:titus@caltech.edu>`__ if you're interested.  No
reservations needed, but we should probably all plan to meet at the
same time ;).

   There is nothing posted on the SciPy 2007 site yet.  Is it really
   happening this year?  No schedule, etc.
