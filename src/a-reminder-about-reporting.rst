Sometimes you've really got to wonder.

The Chronical of Higher Ed just posted `this article
<http://chronicle.com/article/BiologistsHumanities/138661/?cid=wc&utm_sourc>`__
on a collaboration between A. Sean Pue, Tracy K. Teal, and myself.
It's about bringing bioinformatics (or, really, CS and computational
linguistics) to the study of Urdu poetic meter.

The article has two interesting flaws.

First, not one person in the article is referred to as "Professor" or
"Dr", despite basically everyone in the article having both a PhD and
being a professor.  Understandable in Time Magazine.  But in the
Chronicle of Higher Ed, I would assume that the distinctions between
these academic titles are well understood.

Second, the article completely omits mention of The Third
Collaborator, i.e. me.  I didn't go to the NEH/NIH meeting, but they
actually sent a photog out to MSU so that I could be included in
pictures -- and they seem to have chosen the one picture that *didn't*
actually have me in it (I'm lower right, just outside the camera
frame).  What?

I've talked to enough reporters now to recognize that often the
published story bears only a casual resemblance to the truth,
especially when there's a good creation myth in the offing.  But it's
always good to have some blatant examples to wave around.
