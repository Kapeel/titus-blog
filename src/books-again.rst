A few books that stand out in my mind, among those that I've read
recently:

`The Historian <http://www.amazon.com/Historian-Elizabeth-Kostova/dp/0316011770>`__

`Middlesex <http://www.amazon.com/Middlesex-A-Novel-Jeffrey-Eugenides/dp/0312422156>`__

`The Time Traveler's Wife <http://www.amazon.com/Time-Travelers-Wife-Audrey-Niffenegger/dp/015602943X>`__

`Calamity Physics <http://www.amazon.com/Special-Topics-Calamity-Physics-Marisha/dp/067003777X>`__

`The Geographer's Library <http://www.amazon.com/Geographers-Library-Jon-Fasman/dp/1594200386>`__

`The Codex <http://www.amazon.com/Codex-Lev-Grossman/dp/0151010668>`__

Briefly, The Historian is a fabulous book about the search for Vlad
Dracula.  Middlesex is ... hard to explain.  It's a Pulitzer winner
and it's by the author of the Virgin Suicides (but much better).  The
Time Traveler's Wife is a fantastic story about an oddly tragic love
affair.  Calamity Physics is hard to explain, but it's a fun read. The
Geographer's Library and The Codex are both pseudo-intellectual books
about the search for buried historical treasure; The Codex is the
least good of them, I think.

If you have to choose only one or two, I'd recommend going in order
of the list above.

If you've liked any one of these, I bet that you'll like the rest.

Most of these books fall in the same "fantastic" category as
`Possession
<http://www.amazon.com/Possession-Romance-S-Byatt/dp/0679735909>`__
and `Hallucinating Foucault
<http://www.amazon.co.uk/Hallucinating-Foucault-Patricia-Duncker/dp/033035177X>`__

You can see a bunch of books that were highly recommended to me (or,
in a few cases, are trashy sci fi books that I want to read ;) on `my
Amazon wish list
<http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/30AP0UAK7Y0WX/ref=wl_web/>`__.
Probably the most intriguing is "World War Z: An Oral History of the
Zombie War"...
