So, it looks like I will be giving a talk on twill, scotch, and figleaf
at PyCon!  One of the reviewers said something very nice, albeit probably
unjustified; to quote: ::

   ...twill is more or less Py web-developer 101 at this point, so a talk
   about it should be enlightening.

Hmm, guess I'd better get twill 0.9 out then, eh?  Note to Ian
Bicking: I'm planning on talking about some of the Paste/WSGI testing
fixtures as well.

Something else that's particularly nice is that I'll be part of a
whole talk session on testing.  Hint, there's a fun twist to it that
I'm sure you'll all appreciate *if you come to the session*.  (If you
don't come, then I'm not going to tell you what the twist is -- and you'll
be missing out!)

The `PyCon Web Panel
<http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/oct-06/pycon-web-panel.html>`__ will also
be happening, but I'm a bit more apprehensive about this because it's
a *big* responsibility: if it sucks, I may very well be stoned to
death (and rightly so!).  Oh, and I need to find people interested in
representing web.py, Quixote and twisted.web.  (I already have Jim
Fulton (Zope), Ben Bangert (Pylons), Adrian Holovaty (Django), Robert
Brewer (CherryPy), and probably Kevin Dangoor (TurboGears).)  I asked
Aaron Swartz and Neil Schemenauer about web.py and Quixote respectively;
neither one is coming.  Any ideas who to ask about twisted.web?

Please `drop me a line <mailto:titus@idyll.org>`__ if you have thoughts
on questions to be asked, people to recruit, or moral support to offer ;).

p.s. No word on the Testing Tutorial yet...
