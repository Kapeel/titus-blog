Wireless data uplink

Dear lazyweb,

does anyone have any thoughts on how to get a relatively inexpensive wireless
data uplink to the Internet from a Mac OS X laptop?  We're going to be spending
some time in a location with decent cell coverage but no wi-fi, and I'd like to
be able to access the Internet from there.

I know there are cell providers that do this, but I'd rather not get locked
into a contract... pay-as-you-go would be preferable.  We're only talking 2-6
days.

thanks,
--titus

p.s. Please either comment, or `drop me a line <mailto:titus@idyll.org>`__.  Thanks!

   If you figure it out, let me know!    I know about these:      <a

   href="http://www.evdoinfo.com/">http://www.evdoinfo.com/</a>    but I
   don't know if either of them suits your needs or not...

   The evdo card rental on evodinfo.com seems good, but it's awfully
   expensive.    --titus
