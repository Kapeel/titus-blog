Course page at: http://ged.msu.edu/courses/2010-fall-cse-891/:

       This course will introduce biologists to computational
       thinking, practical computational techniques, and research
       topics in computational evolution. The course will consist of
       three intensive hands-on 5-week modules: computational
       competence in UNIX; data mining and hypothesis generation using
       the Avida digital life platform and computational analysis of
       large-scale resequencing data from the Lenski Lab E. coli
       long-term evolution experiment.

This course is one of the two required entry courses for BEACON, an
NSF-funded center for the study of Evolution in Action (see
www.beacon.msu.edu).

The course will have 15-20 students from Michigan State (MSU), 2-3
from UW Seattle, 1-2 from U Idaho, and 2-3 from UT Austin (all
partners in BEACON).

Briefly, we will be using EC2 and S3 to

1) demonstrate remote computer use and remote data analysis

2) compile, install, and run the Avida Digital Life system (see http://devolab.msu.edu and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avida)

3) do resequencing analysis of the Lenski Lab's E. coli long-term evolution experiment (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._coli_long-term_evolution_experiment)

All of our materials will be made freely available under a Creative
Commons license, as with my last EC2-using course (see:
http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/jun-10/ngs-course-postmortem.html and
http://ged.msu.edu/angus/).

We also hope to "export" this course outside of BEACON in the future.

--

I am open to a few people from outside the BEACON consortium attending
the course via teleconf, although we may not grade your homework :).
Let me know if this is of interest to you: ctb@msu.edu.

(Sigh, of 6 total semesters in which I've taught at MSU, I've taught 4
new courses.  What am I thinking??)

   Awesome, Titus! Let me know if you need an expensive consultant who
   knows how to scale your systems in the cloud and how to keep them up
   and running 24x7 ;-)

   Sorry, Grig, that appears to be ... me.  Except for the 24x7.  And
   "expensive".  Alas.
